---- INSTALATION GUIDELINES -----

[1] Install Ejabberd, see ejabberd_setup.text

[2] Create MySQL database, see structure mysql.sql Change config.php to your own database. 

[3] Get API Key & API ID for Facebook Javascript SDK --> create your own web service through Facebook Developers. 
Insert API ID in index.html as follows:

window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
  FB.init({
    appId      : 'YOUR OWN APID',
    cookie     : true,  // enable cookies to allow the server to access 
                        // the session
    xfbml      : true,  // parse social plugins on this page
    version    : 'v2.1' // use version 2.1
  });

[4] If working with Ted Talks API, get API key using http://developer.ted.com/ and 
insert it get_random_tedtalks.php, get_tedtalks.php, get_tedtalks_by_id.php and get_tedtalks_related.php.

[5] If working with another data, take into account that it needs to be able to extract dataset using 
HTTP-Request, JSON structure if possible, otherwise it will be more tedious. In this case, 
working with another dataset, change php scripts realted to TED tals as get_random_tedtalks.php, 
get_tedtalks.php, get_tedtalks_by_id.php and get_tedtalks_related.php, 
and insert your own http-request query with the correct API Key. 
--> Use in member-indez.php the function changeData(data) to set up your JSON prefered structure. 
---> Additionally include HTML code to visualize it.  

******* IMPORTANT *******

If the platform is developed with a different url than http://localhost/N-Screen/ change it 
in index.html and member-index.php like this (for example):

from--> history.pushState(state, "N-Screen", "http://localhost/N-Screen/");
to -->  history.pushState(state, "N-Screen", "http://begona-nscreen.crowdtruth.org/"); //for remote server

or

from--> history.pushState(state, "N-Screen", "http://localhost/N-Screen/");
to -->  history.pushState(state, "N-Screen", "http://localhost/Your_Own_Folder_In_Localhost/"); //for localhost
