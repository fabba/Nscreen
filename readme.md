# Prototyping of a Browser-Based Social N-Screen Platform - Master Thesis - LOCALHOST SOURCE-CODE
This is a web-based application that allows multiple people to go to a URL in a browser, drag and drop 
programmes between each other, and drag and drop programmes to a ' VirtualTV' to play them. 
It can be used to find and watch on-demand TV when 'together but apart'.

A second screen is a hand-device which is susceptible to provide added value to the TV content consumption. Notube, with their web browser-based second screen application, moved further through this concept, creating an assosiation between the second screen, Web and TV content. Nevertheless, the implemention still lacks completion in order achieve a full service and its users' satisfaction.

This project shows the development of a social N-Screen prototype. The main goal was to re-design, implement and improve the functionality, interactivity and user experience of the browser-based second screen recommender platform carried out by Notube, in order to provide a functional and attractive platform that can be used to graphically test different recommendation strategies. 

## Installation
The setup requires an EJabberd installation with Bosh enabled, and various simple APIs to the data. The 
actual client is very simple - javascript and HTML with strophe and jquery - it works in modern 
browsers. The eJabberd server can be on a separate machine. 

See install.txt and ejabberd_setup.txt
