2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In July 1944, the British Army staged its biggest-ever tank attack.

3
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,960
Many hoped that it would be the great breakthrough,

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,480
a charge to shatter the Germans and win the battle for Normandy.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,320
Referring to the glories of British horse racing, it was codenamed "Operation Goodwood".

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,000
On the 6th of June 1944, the Allies landed in Normandy in the greatest-ever seaborne invasion.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,160
In the days and weeks that followed, they poured in men and equipment.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,280
Some of them landed here at Arromanches

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,720
at the artificial Mulberry Harbour whose durable remains are behind me.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,160
There were two harbours.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,960
Each as big as the port of Dover, they enabled the landing of men and equipment on an unparalleled scale.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,720
By the end of June, less than a month after the landings,

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,880
the Allies had 875,000 men and 150,000 vehicles in Normandy.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,680
MUSIC: "In The Mood" by Glenn Miller

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,800
But they were going nowhere.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,880
Landing in Normandy was relatively easy. Breaking out into France was much more difficult.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,040
The landings, along a 50-mile stretch of Normandy coast, had been a huge success.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:42,120
But the Allies found it hard to exploit their advantage and were slow to begin their advance inland.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm going to follow the route the Allies took in early June as they attempted to move inland,

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,200
beyond the coast they'd seized on D-Day.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Their forces moved west of Caen into the countryside known as Bocage.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,400
It's made up of fields surrounded by hedges growing out of high banks.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,640
In 1944, it covered a huge area, and the Allies had no choice but to fight their way through it.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,560
There's less "bocage" than there once was, as ancient hedges get grubbed up to make big new fields.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,920
But we can still gain a very vivid sense of how terrifying it must have been to fight here

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,480
with minimal visibility and knowing the enemy might be round the corner.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,080
The area seemed made for defence and the Germans pinned the Allies down.

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,120
In this war of attrition, the Allies had a big advantage over the Germans in that they had many more tanks.

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,480
But tanks were of limited use in the labyrinth of the bocage, and were very vulnerable.

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,160
This is cheap and simple. It's called a "Panzerfaust" - tank fist.

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,240
This shaped charge will go through the armour of a Sherman tank.

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:19,160
To fire it, you simply flip up the sight - it's only sighted to 60 metres - cock it, aim and fire.

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,920
You chuck it away and grab another.

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,680
Germany infantry used these in their hundreds in the bocage,

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,080
taking on tanks from point-blank range and then scampering back to another hedgerow to try again.

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,720
This fighting style wore men out and led some Allied commanders to wonder how they'd EVER get out of Normandy.

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,600
Their tanks were obviously not going to get them through the bocage, so the Allies relied on their infantry.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,280
For them, it was every bit as dangerous as the First World War. They suffered very high casualties.

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,960
But after four weeks of fighting,

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,880
they were still stuck fast, just a few miles from the sea.

41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,800
This cemetery at Bayeux is the largest Second World War British cemetery in Europe.

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,720
It is tragic evidence that by July 1944 the Allies had suffered severely.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,920
The British had lost nearly 25,000 men, killed and wounded.

44
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,680
When considering what to do next,

45
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,400
British commanders were anxious to let armour plate bear the brunt.

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,000
The British Army was simply running out of men.

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,640
In the air, however, it was a different story.

48
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,640
Allied fighters and bombers enjoyed absolute command of the skies.

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,480
The Allied commanders planned a new break-out that would utilise their air power.

50
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,400
Their target was the city of Caen, the historic capital of Normandy.

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,960
It's a thriving city today, showing little sign of the horrors that it witnessed in 1944.

52
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,320
But the town's new university is symbolic.

53
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:37,600
It represents the resurrection of a city that was all but obliterated by the Allies who came to liberate it.

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm up on the battlements of William the Conqueror's castle in Caen, just a few miles from the sea.

55
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Caen had been a D-Day objective, but the Allies had failed to take it.

56
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,720
A month after the landings, it was still in German hands.

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Allied bombing proved to be a blunt instrument.

58
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,440
Caen and its people suffered badly; the Germans, scarcely at all.

59
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Andre Heintz was a resistance worker in Caen.

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,720
- You were here during the war?
- Yes. 
- How many aerial raids do you recall?

61
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,240
- Well, I remember at least 24 after D-Day until the liberation of Caen. 
- And which was the worst?

62
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,160
They were all bad, but especially the four that involved more than 300 planes.

63
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,120
- Were many people killed? 
- Probably 6,000, which is a lot,

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,080
but at one time, we thought there might be many more than that.

65
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,760
- What did people do while all this was going on?
- The people all rushed towards that church over there -

66
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,760
the Abbaye aux Hommes, the men's abbey.

67
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,720
There were at least 16,000 people sheltering there.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,280
On the night of the 7th of July,

69
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,920
the city was pounded by 460 heavy bombers.

70
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:15,960
The British hoped to obliterate the Germans, take the city and then sweep into the open country beyond.

71
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,360
The bombing produced so much rubble that the advance ground to a halt.

72
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,720
Caen's southern suburbs remained in German hands.

73
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Yet another Allied breakthrough attempt had failed.

74
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,360
The need to achieve the elusive break-out

75
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,640
was becoming an increasing problem for the Allied ground forces commander, Sir Bernard Montgomery.

76
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,320
Montgomery set up his headquarters here at Creully, near the invasion beaches.

77
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,880
It was typical of the spartan Monty to live, not in the chateau itself, but in a caravan in the garden.

78
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,480
His armies, Bradley's Americans to the west and Dempsey's British and Canadians to the east, were stuck.

79
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,520
Montgomery was under pressure to do something.

80
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,440
In mid-July, he wrote that he'd decided to have a real showdown

81
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,080
and to send three armoured divisions into the country south-east of Caen.

82
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,840
We can't be sure if he really expected to break through,

83
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,400
or simply to attract German armour so that the Americans could stage an attack of their own called "Cobra".

84
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,160
In any event, this was the genesis of Operation Goodwood.

85
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Goodwood was to be a tank battle on a scale never seen before in Western Europe.

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
The British had 2,500 tanks in Normandy.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,040
Montgomery planned to use them to take the pressure off the infantry.

88
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,840
The workhorse of Allied armoured divisions in Normandy was the American-built Sherman.

89
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,760
The Allies had almost limitless supplies of Shermans, with thousands leaving American production lines.

90
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Victory in Normandy would depend on the performance of the Sherman and its crew. Men such as Ken Tout.

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,400
- Well, Ken, shall we look inside? 
- Why not?

92
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,760
Ken, you were a Sherman gunner in Normandy. Who else was in the crew?

93
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,760
You had five on the Sherman, which had this 75mm gun.

94
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,200
There would be the commander - Ken Snowden from Darlington - whose knees would be stuck in my back,

95
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,120
and where you are, there would be the loader, Tommy Tucker, who was always eating.

96
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,720
In front was Rex Jackson, who got the Military Medal, and lives in Braintree.

97
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Rex was the co-driver with his own machine gun, and the driver was Stan Hickin.

98
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,280
The five of us were a family living together, in touch with each other.

99
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,040
What did your job actually involve?

100
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,760
Well, as the gunner, you were simply concentrating on this gun.

101
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,400
You had a periscope here to look through

102
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,640
which gave you a sort of camera angle on the outside.

103
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,960
You could then control the gun here, which is fired by triggers.

104
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,280
I've got two little triggers down here - left foot or right foot.

105
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,640
What was it like living in a tank?

106
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,160
You had the stench of the cordite as the tank gun opened up and ejected all the gas and smells.

107
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,680
You had the sweaty smell from fear and unwashed bodies - you didn't often get the chance to shower.

108
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,640
You had the difficulty of natural functions - you couldn't get out to do the toilet.

109
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,640
So you'd take an empty ammunition tin and you'd discreetly do a pee in the corner.

110
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,520
All that together and worse things - it's not unknown to vomit with fear.

111
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:33,040
This, after say 24 hours, in this little space, accumulated a smell which is undescribable.

112
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,200
It was only equalled by the smell outside of literally thousands of dead cattle unburied

113
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,360
and bodies unfound and unburied, which pervaded the atmosphere from the beaches upwards.

114
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,120
This was the Allied front line.

115
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,720
Goodwood was to take place on the 18th of July, south-east of Caen.

116
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,840
The landscape is open, rolling plain. It was good tank country.

117
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,400
It was the best option for a break-out, led by the armoured divisions.

118
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,800
The plan was for a massive aerial bombardment to breach German lines,

119
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,960
then British armour would pour into the open country beyond.

120
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,720
Montgomery may not have been confident of a breakthrough,

121
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,560
but the Goodwood creator, General Dempsey, was optimistic.

122
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,640
"It's more than possible," he wrote, "that the Huns will break."

123
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,960
The Germans had fortified a belt of villages running across the plain

124
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,560
and extending about six miles in depth.

125
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,880
Most villages had a small garrison made up of tanks, artillery, infantry and anti-tank guns.

126
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,880
They were to be attacked by three full-strength British armoured divisions, following 2,000 bombers.

127
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,600
The effect was to be shattering.

128
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,360
MUSIC: "Four Sea Interludes" by Benjamin Britten

129
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:53,440
The bombardment was on a vast scale, many times greater than the raid that had devastated Caen.

130
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,560
The villages themselves were almost wiped off the map. Centuries of history obliterated in a morning.

131
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,200
The school in Demouville may look old, but it was rebuilt from a pile of rubble after the war.

132
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,960
So many of these Norman villages were completely destroyed and only rebuilt after the war.

133
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,120
The war memorial lists the civilians killed, including the mayor.

134
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,560
It was hellish even for the Germans. Their tanks were thrown like toys.

135
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,400
One remembered how it was a regular carpet bombardment,

136
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,240
"Amongst the sound of the explosions

137
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,840
"we could hear the screams of the wounded and those driven mad."

138
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,120
To take advantage, the British had to quickly launch their tanks.

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,680
But there was a problem.

140
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,280
Most still had to cross the Orne and the Caen Canal to reach the plain.

141
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,200
The British built three pairs of bridges - one here, one upstream and one downstream -

142
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,880
to ferry the three attacking divisions.

143
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,320
There were over 8,000 vehicles in all.

144
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,960
Surprise was essential for the success of Goodwood.

145
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,920
But the Germans could observe the area from the chimneys of a factory outside Caen.

146
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,600
So the river crossing had to be made at the last minute.

147
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,520
It was a bottleneck and the armoured divisions were crawling forward

148
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,360
when they had to be at full speed.

149
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,520
To make matters worse, this area, which the attackers had to cross, was a minefield.

150
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,320
Some narrow gaps had been made, and at 7.45 the two leading regiments -

151
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,080
3rd Royal Tanks and the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry - squeezed through.

152
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,120
This is an anti-tank mine. It is buried just below the surface.

153
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,440
It supports the weight of a soldier, but blows up when a tank crosses it.

154
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,960
Ironically, it's a British mine. The British laid hundreds of mines here in the weeks before Goodwood.

155
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,800
They hadn't marked their position properly and the whole area had been disturbed by shell-fire.

156
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,560
Of the first British tanks blasted, many were blown up on British mines.

157
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,040
I've walked about two miles south from the minefield.

158
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,560
In 1944, there was a railway line here and the leading tanks got this far with little difficulty,

159
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,120
passing ruins and shell-shocked Germans with British artillery fire falling just in front of them.

160
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,720
The battlefield was so narrow that the attackers were stacked behind a single regiment, 3rd Royal Tanks.

161
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Just behind them were the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry with Lance Corporal Ron Cox.

162
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,680
"We moved forward some distance behind a barrage and then stopped.

163
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:25,200
"I remember opening a new tin of jam and spreading it thickly on biscuits and passing them round the crew.

164
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,720
"We exchanged banter.

165
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,840
"I think the humour was a bit forced for we were all aware that this would be something big.

166
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,960
"My own emotion was a kind of numbed fatalism."

167
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,840
The Allied tank crews knew the dangers that lay ahead.

168
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,880
Most German tanks had better guns and the Sherman had a fatal tendency to explode as soon as it was hit.

169
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,720
The worry was that you knew just behind you - that distance away -

170
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,440
you had a massive engine and petrol tank notorious for exploding

171
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,280
and you'd just seconds to get out.

172
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,600
It'd go up in flames. The Germans called the tank a "Tommy cooker",

173
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,280
which was funny unless YOU were the Tommy involved.

174
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,800
The depressing thing was that the Allies' tanks were not as powerful as the German tanks.

175
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,920
You knew you were a featherweight going up against Mike Tyson.

176
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,720
It was horrifying that there was a Tiger tank out there

177
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,240
that could knock you out from a mile and a half.

178
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,920
- What range would you have to get to? 
- With this gun, about 200-300 yards!

179
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,680
The Allies expected to lose at least five Shermans for every Tiger they managed to destroy.

180
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:05,040
It was a dreadful rate of exchange, but the Allies could afford it much better than the Germans.

181
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,000
By mid-morning, the attacks seemed to be going well for the British.

182
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,920
3rd Royal Tanks had passed Cagny, just in front of me,

183
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,160
and the Fife and Forfars were coming on between here and that hamlet.

184
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:30,320
At this stage, Major Hans von Luck, a regimental commander in 21st Panzer Division, arrived.

185
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,280
Luck reached Cagny to see four 88mm Luftwaffe guns, barrels skywards.

186
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,040
He told them to face the tanks, but their captain wanted to hit bombers.

187
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Luck drew his pistol and told the officer that he could win a high decoration or die on the spot.

188
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,520
The officer did the rational thing and soon that field was filled with burning Shermans.

189
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,560
MUSIC: "Four Sea Interludes" by Benjamin Britten

190
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,000
The 88s firing from here were anti-aircraft guns

191
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and these huge brass shell cases pushed their shot out at thousands of feet a second.

192
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,600
This is what did the damage.

193
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,480
It's a steel, armour-piercing shell.

194
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,560
When it hit a Sherman, it almost never failed, in the jargon of the day, to "brew up".

195
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,040
3rd Royal Tanks were clear of Cagny when the Luftwaffe 88s opened fire.

196
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:30,320
The regiment crossed that railway line and immediately came under fire from anti-tank guns in this village.

197
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,360
Major Bill Close remembered that they dealt with some German guns simply by running over them.

198
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,160
"The anti-tank guns were a different matter.

199
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,480
"At very close range, they hit three of my tanks which burst into flames

200
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,120
"and I could see that the squadron on my left also had several tanks blazing."

201
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,200
The Royal Tanks had orders to bypass the village

202
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
and pushed on under another railway line using tunnels like this.

203
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,480
The regiment could now see its final objective, the Bourguebus ridge.

204
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,920
By midday, the British were making slow but steady progress across the battlefield.

205
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,160
Yet if the bombing had at first anaesthetised the Germans, its effects had now worn off.

206
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,520
The defenders of the villages ahead were ready for the British attack.

207
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,080
Worse still, the experienced 1st SS Panzer Division crept round Caen

208
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,600
and by midday, its tanks and assault guns were in position on that ridge.

209
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,800
Despite earlier losses of about 12 tanks apiece,

210
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,840
the Royal Tanks and the Fife and Forfars still had 40 tanks each.

211
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,680
Early in the afternoon, they began to attack that ridge.

212
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,040
The Royal Tanks on this side of the line made for Hubert-Folie and Bras.

213
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,600
One officer wrote...

214
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,080
"I saw many Shermans in flames and thought there'd soon be nothing left."

215
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,000
MUSIC: "Four Sea Interludes" by Benjamin Britten

216
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,200
Wounded crews came back here to the embankment.

217
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:13,240
The Royal Tanks had lost 41 of their Shermans. It was clear that, for the time being, the attack had stalled.

218
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,440
Regiments in the rear were still advancing when wounded men and crippled tanks began to limp back,

219
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,640
withdrawing from the ferocious German fire.

220
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,560
Thick pillars of smoke marked the fate of the two leading regiments

221
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,560
when the 23rd Hussars advanced in the hope of supporting them.

222
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:57,320
Lieutenant Geoffrey Bishop described hearing his squadron leader give his orders in an excited, clear voice.

223
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,080
They were to be his last.

224
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,120
Then it was the familiar story of Shermans brewing up. The regiment lost 26 very quickly.

225
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,720
Lieutenant Bishop was about here.

226
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:16,680
He describes how "the medical officer had fixed up a dressing station in a signal box

227
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,720
"and casualties started streaming back from the burnt-out tanks.

228
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,240
"The chaps were all blackened, their clothes burnt.

229
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,360
"A tank which had survived came roaring back with the wounded."

230
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,440
The Northamptonshire Yeomanry made the last charge of the day and lost another 16 tanks.

231
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,880
By now it was perfectly clear that there wouldn't be a breakthrough.

232
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:52,520
The British, however, held their ground and managed to push further forward over the next two days.

233
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,960
The total advance was just seven miles, but it was a valuable gain.

234
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,320
Montgomery issued a press release extolling the success of Goodwood.

235
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,360
But when it emerged how small the advance had been for such losses,

236
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,480
he found himself in hot water with the politicians and his superiors.

237
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,080
One historian called Goodwood, "the death ride of the armoured divisions".

238
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,920
The British and Canadians lost 400 tanks and nearly 6,000 men.

239
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,520
The battle was more a blood bath than a breakthrough.

240
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,880
The best we can say of it is that it brought the Allies one step closer to liberating Normandy.

241
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:53,400
This memorial on Montormel commemorates the Allies who died at the end of the battle for Normandy.

242
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,920
Less than a week after Goodwood, the Americans began Operation Cobra and soon broke out deep into France.

243
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:08,440
In early August, the Germans were trapped between the Allied armies down there in the Falaise pocket.

244
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,640
In these killing fields, the Germans were strafed by aircraft and bombarded by artillery.

245
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,960
About 10,000 of them were killed and 50,000 were captured.

246
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,080
By the end of August, the struggle for Normandy was over.

247
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:34,920
A historian must never say "never", yet we may hope it marks the end of a barbarous dynasty of battles,

248
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,960
which had ruled Western Europe for more than five centuries

249
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,160
since English archers and French knights fought to the death on the field of Agincourt.

250
