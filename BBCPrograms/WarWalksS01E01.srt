MUSIC: "The Agincourt Carol"

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,680
In October 1415, starving and riddled with disease,

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,280
an English army beat a French force that outnumbered it by five to one.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,640
This epic victory has flashes of storybook heroism,

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,240
and a darker side of horror and butchery.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,280
Today, you can still follow in King Henry V's footsteps

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
on the road that leads to Agincourt.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,000
It's never been easier for an Englishman to get to France,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,600
but when Henry V took his army here 600 years ago, it took two days to make the crossing.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,080
He believed that he was rightfully King of France. On 11th August 1415,

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,000
he sailed from Southampton for this little port of Harfleur.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560
He hoped to use it as a base -

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,880
perhaps to overrun Normandy or threaten Paris -

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
and expected to take it easily.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,200
BATTLE CRIES

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead!

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,120
If you can only recite one line from Shakespeare's Henry V, that'll be it.

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,200
Harfleur was a walled town - held by determined garrison.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Although Henry's primitive cannon knocked about the forts and houses,

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,720
the siege went on for over a month.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,240
The centre of Harfleur is a tangle of medieval alleys,

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,840
scattered with restaurants and superb fresh food shops.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,560
But if the English had been hoping for a gastronomic crusade,

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,160
they were in for a nasty surprise.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,200
Their supplies ran low so they tried some unsuccessful location catering.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,280
True to being Englishmen abroad, Henry's men laid into local seafood.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,600
It came, then, from marshes which were, in effect, the town's sewers.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,360
Dysentery broke out in the cramped and filthy siege lines.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,320
2,000 of Henry's men died. Others became so ill they were shipped home.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
But the French were in worse trouble.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,080
The garrison knew if Henry took the town by force, they'd be annihilated.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,920
But if they surrendered, they might escape with their lives.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,440
With no relief in sight by September, the gates were opened to the English.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,360
Many townspeople had sheltered in the 11th-century church of St Martin to escape the English siege cannon.

35
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,080
On the 23rd September, Henry walked barefoot here,

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,880
to give thanks for a victory which cost him a quarter of his men.

37
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,200
These losses meant he had to rethink his campaign.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,720
His advisors recommended that he should garrison Harfleur and go home.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,320
But Henry, ever convinced of the rightness of his cause,

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,200
decided to march straight through French territory to Calais.

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Although only 28, Henry was already an experienced soldier.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,880
He'd fought successfully against his father's English and Welsh opponents.

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,560
He now hoped to mount a lightning raid through France,

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,480
travelling fast with the force of 900 men-at-arms and 5,000 archers.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,880
They'd live off the land, or more to the point, off its French inhabitants,

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,720
who can't have welcomed the bedraggled, diseased Englishmen

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,000
whose hunger grew with every mile.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,840
By car, you can cover Henry's route from Harfleur to Calais in a day...

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,560
more comfortably in two.

50
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,520
But it took his army three days to reach Arques, 60 miles from Harfleur.

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,040
There are traces of the woods that would have cloaked the land then.

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,680
But much of the country is rolling, open farmland.

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,040
The great castle at Arques is now a hulking ruin,

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
high on a bluff overlooking the town.

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,960
When Henry came on October 16th 1415,

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,960
the gates were barred.

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,440
Henry at once sent an envoy to the gates and demanded food.

58
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,600
But the governor's resolve was less solid than the walls of his keep.

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,280
He knew what had gone on at Harfleur,

60
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,880
and that the French army would probably not relieve him.

61
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,520
The town below the castle was at Henry's mercy,

62
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,720
so the English marched on, loaded with bread and wine from Arques.

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Add non-combatants to men-at-arms and archers, and there are about 10,000 men in Henry's army.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,080
That made it larger than most English towns of the day. That was a lot of mouths to feed.

65
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,120
The men expected two pounds of bread and half a pound of meat every day.

66
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,040
The army was a huge maggot, eating its way across the countryside.

67
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,960
Drink was the enemy of discipline, and armies had a strong taste for it.

68
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,000
Later in the campaign, a commander told Henry his men were simply filling their bottles with wine.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Henry snapped back that they made bottles of their bellies and were very drunk. But who can blame them?

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,440
Miles from home, stranded in a foreign country, marching in the rain, outnumbered five to one.

71
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,400
It's small wonder that many saw all this as more of a dangerous pub crawl than a crusade.

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,920
This was Henry's real problem.

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,360
The River Somme lay between him and his objective, Calais.

74
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,160
He had hoped to cross it here, by the ford at Blanchetaque.

75
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,080
But upon arrival on the 13th October,

76
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,720
he found the ford blocked with stakes and the far bank garrisoned.

77
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Indeed, the French held all the bridges and fords along the Somme.

78
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Henry had to find a place to cross,

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,600
and the spirits of his army must have sunk lower by the minute.

80
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Heavy rains turned the swampy Somme Valley into a cloying morass.

81
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Many of Henry's soldiers suffered from dysentery so badly that they had cut away their breeches.

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,560
On the other side, was a powerful French army, growing by the day.

83
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,440
During their long march,

84
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,800
Henry issued an order that must have added to the burden of despair.

85
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Henry's archers were heavily laden,

86
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,080
but he told each to cut a six-foot stake and to sharpen it at both ends.

87
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,920
It was a burden that none could have welcomed, but later their lives were to depend upon it.

88
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:29,480
The road goes through water meadow and woodland, along the Somme Valley, to Henry's next destination.

89
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,440
Henry arrived here at Boves, near Amiens, on the 16th October.

90
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,120
It was now clear that his plan of campaign had gone wrong.

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,120
The army couldn't cross the Somme and it was fast running out of food.

92
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,640
Henry blackmailed the garrison here into giving him bread

93
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,320
by threatening to burn the town if they didn't supply it.

94
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
But there was too little to go round.

95
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Soon, the men had to forage in the fields for nuts and vegetables -

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,760
bad news for an army of carnivores.

97
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,440
The Somme remained an impassable barrier, even for Henry's lightly equipped force.

98
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,640
Every crossing was guarded. Every ford was held.

99
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,120
There were fords across the Somme here at Bethencourt and at nearby Voyennes.

100
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,920
The causeways were broken but on the 19th October, the English repaired them using timber from nearby houses.

101
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,560
And by nightfall, Henry's army was across the last major natural obstacle between it and Calais.

102
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Yet there was another even greater obstacle on Henry's route home.

103
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,600
Calais was 100 miles away and the French outnumbered them five to one.

104
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
At first, Henry could avoid them

105
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,520
but a few miles from the tiny village of Agincourt,

106
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,400
his route was finally blocked.

107
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,520
Agincourt's not a battle the French commemorate with great enthusiasm.

108
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,240
It's the kind of thing that can sour an entente cordiale

109
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,880
if mentioned at the wrong time.

110
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,680
In the village there's a tiny, but well-intentioned, museum.

111
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,600
Here, glamorous myths are perpetuated.

112
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,480
For instance, at Agincourt the English fought largely on foot.

113
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
And so, for that matter, did the French.

114
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,360
Men-at-arms on both sides wore full armour.

115
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,440
To give us some idea of how it looked, Ian Pyecroft is here to help.

116
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,320
I've started with long riding boots and a quilted arming jacket.

117
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,840
Where do we go from here?

118
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,920
- We'll put on your cuisse and poleyn leg protection.
- I'm in your hands.

119
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,040
You must have full flexibility in this.

120
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,600
The surprising thing so far, is that this doesn't feel at all bad.

121
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,240
The mail shirt is composed of about 20,000 riveted iron rings. Arms through the holes.

122
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,360
- Looking good!
- Looking good, feeling fit. It weighs about 15lbs.

123
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,840
Your father's polished breastplate.

124
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,720
- What's a grand guard? 
- It protects the inside of the elbow.

125
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,520
- It's the same as the...?
- Side wings.

126
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,960
The shield was becoming obsolete by this time.

127
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,840
- This piece of articulated iron does the same job as your ancestor's shield.
- The articulation works.

128
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,480
A linen coif.

129
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,280
Try this on. A basinet with a mail aventail, or a mail collar, already attached.

130
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll bring the mail collar out to protect all the joints.

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,640
Cover up all the gaps.

132
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Here we've got some fine, Gothic-style gauntlets, as made in Germany.

133
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,040
Wonderfully lightweight, but heavily fluted.

134
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,240
The little ridges and flutes make them strong.

135
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,560
- This could give a deft blow to an unprotected face. 
- Yes, they've spiked knuckles.

136
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,560
I'll bring the hound-skull visor down - hound-skull because it has a semblance of a dog's skull shape.

137
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,600
I'll give you an example of how blows would glance off the armour.

138
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,360
Can we make the blows as glancing as possible, please?

139
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
Here we've a small, blunted for safety reasons...a small sword.

140
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,680
CLANGING

141
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,240
- That was surprisingly unpainful. Well-padded.
- This is the idea.

142
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,000
You've got a good shape for a late-14th-century knight.

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,080
The only problem is you can't strike back,

144
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,480
unless you peck them to death with your visor.

145
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,520
- So if we lift the visor so you can breathe more easily.
- That's better!

146
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,640
I think it's time you had a weapon.

147
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,160
This one...weighs about three and a half pounds.

148
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
It could be used in one or two hands.

149
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Razor-sharp.

150
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,440
You can thrust with it.

151
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,480
A good blow from above your head could cut a man virtually in half.

152
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,720
- It is actually... 
- We have excavations from a battle in Denmark,

153
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,880
showing skeletons which have been separated...

154
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,560
from the shoulder to the groin.

155
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,040
This is a poleaxe or a war hammer - a two-handed, vicious weapon,

156
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,760
designed for cracking plate armour,

157
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,000
penetrating mail, punching through helmets.

158
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,520
- You can see the damage it could do. 
- Yes, I can thrust with this part...

159
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,640
- It's swung over the head... 
- I can pierce mail with that. 
- That'll puncture any known armour.

160
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,680
This is a very satisfactory weapon.

161
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,400
I can imagine myself wading into somebody with that.

162
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,920
It fills you with a desire to give a swipe at whatever's within distance.

163
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,560
Well, the armour fits quite well

164
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,760
and was quite comfortable when I started.

165
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,600
But after a few hundred yards,

166
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm really conscious of the weight of it all

167
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,600
and the abrasion on the whole of my body.

168
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,840
I can't see really very much without...

169
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,640
turning my head from side to side.

170
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,160
And I can't hear anything.

171
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,800
I certainly couldn't hear any orders that were shouted.

172
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,600
This mud is a real problem.

173
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,280
It's hard to keep my footing and if I fell over, I couldn't get back up.

174
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,760
If the snout of my basinet got jammed into the mud, as it easily might, I'd probably drown.

175
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,800
I can see what a dreadful experience this must have been for the French,

176
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
even before they got hit by arrows.

177
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,240
Despite their finest efforts at metal haute couture,

178
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,520
the French were vulnerable to the English longbow.

179
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,080
The longbow legend IS Agincourt.

180
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,120
'Stephen Burke is so captivated by that legend, that he has visited the battlefield over 100 times.'

181
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,360
This is the famous longbow. How is it actually made? Is it carved?

182
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,920
It's carved normally, so you'd need a six-foot piece of straight timber.

183
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,360
It's like a D-shape. The rounded shape is the belly.

184
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,720
The flat bit is the back. It faces away from you.

185
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,600
- Tell me about the bow string. 
- It's made from different materials including hemp or linen.

186
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
Hemp is the same family as cannabis.

187
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,240
- But it would need looking after. 
- Yes. They would have dozens of spare strings for each archer,

188
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,360
because fraying strings will snap easily.

189
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you need to be strong to use one?

190
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,920
Yes. The Mary Rose evidence almost suggests that they were malformed.

191
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,240
They were built like gorillas - six foot tall and their upper limbs were much bigger than the norm.

192
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,360
- What are you firing from it? 
- Shooting!
- I knew I'd get it!

193
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,320
What we're actually shooting is...

194
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,560
We've got a range here... of various arrowheads

195
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,280
and they've been in the mud so they've picked up mud too.

196
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,360
- But that would be quite a sensible thing to do.
- To pick them up quickly.

197
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,840
And it's biological warfare because the mud then would've had all sorts of ingredients.

198
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,000
We've nocks carved in the wood, but strengthened with a piece of horn.

199
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
- That's actually horn?
- Yes.

200
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,880
The feathers were glued on with a fish glue,

201
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,920
and tied or strengthened by the cord here.

202
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,760
The shafts are ash and at the other end we have the arrowheads.

203
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,920
This long bodkin one here, designed to go through plate and mail.

204
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,240
We've got a bullet point here,

205
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,920
and we've got some armour-piercing ones of different designs.

206
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,920
In films, we see arrows being pulled out of wounds. Possible or not?

207
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,960
- You can't do a John Wayne with them, no.
- Well, let's see you in action.

208
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,200
OK...this is just going to be a general distance...shoot.

209
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
That looks pretty good, I must say.

210
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,480
What's it actually gone into?

211
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,920
What it's gone into is a layer of mail here,

212
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,720
and underneath, 22 layers of fabric.

213
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,120
So our long, bodkin-headed arrows have gone in through the mail,

214
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,960
into the fabric, and if we turn it over, you'll see the head has gone right the way through.

215
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
It went in one side, out the other?

216
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Right through 22 layers of fabric - that's the doeskin on the back - and the second layer of mail.

217
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,720
What's chastening is the idea that when I was in armour today, that covered my stomach.

218
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,240
So archers were unpopular! What did the French do if they caught them?

219
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,680
There were two options. One was to hang them.

220
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,400
The second was to disable them so they couldn't shoot again.

221
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,200
So they'd chop off the fingers they used to shoot the bow - that is, these two fingers here.

222
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,480
That possibly gives us the origin of the old V-sign like this.

223
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,640
Before the battle the archers would prove they could shoot their bows, taunting the French by doing this.

224
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,360
If the two-fingered salute was intended as a morale boost,

225
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,080
the English certainly needed it on the eve of battle.

226
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,440
It was a ghastly night.

227
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,680
Henry's men were tired, wet and hungry.

228
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,080
There was only room enough in the hovels for the king and some nobles.

229
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,120
The men-at-arms and archers spent the night huddled up under hedges.

230
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Henry ordered his army to keep silent.

231
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,840
There was a low murmur as soldiers confessed to chaplains.

232
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,040
If the queues for chaplains were too long, they confessed to friends.

233
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,960
Our spirits are lowest in the small hours, and even Henry's morale wavered that night.

234
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,680
He released prisoners and sent word that he would return Harfleur and pay compensation

235
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,280
if the French would give him free passage to Calais.

236
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
When Sir Walter Hungerford offered another 10,000 archers

237
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,600
the king snapped back that all they had were God's people

238
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,440
and no harm could become a man who trusted the Almighty as he did.

239
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,440
Well, for once the weather's got it about right,

240
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,080
as it was an awful morning on the 25th October 1415,

241
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,920
when Henry's army formed up here, parallel with this road.

242
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,880
We can't be sure what it looked like

243
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,080
but there were probably armoured men-at-arms dismounted in the middle,

244
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,000
and the much more lightly clad archers on either flank.

245
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,480
Henry rode out on a grey pony and addressed his troops.

246
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,160
Then, he dismounted, took position in the centre of his army,

247
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,960
and waited for the French to attack.

248
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Inconveniently, they didn't. They stayed up at their end of the field.

249
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
Eventually, Henry ordered,

250
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,040
"Advance banners in the name of Jesus, Mary and St George!"

251
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,120
The whole line then knelt down...

252
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,600
..kissed the earth -

253
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,640
which most soldiers probably expected would soon cover them -

254
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,280
then, stepped out across the plough towards the French.

255
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,600
It was a long, slow, plodding march with plenty of halts to keep the lines straight.

256
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,040
It was so bad that archers threw away their shoes,

257
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,000
marching barefoot to keep their footing.

258
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,360
A longbow shot from the French, the line halted.

259
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,920
The archers drove in their stakes,

260
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,960
and turned to Sir Thomas Erpingham, a veteran in command of the archers.

261
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,920
He threw his baton high into the air,

262
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,040
and the first arrow to be fired that day flew off into the French line.

263
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,880
The French had mounted detachments on both ends of their line.

264
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,640
They hoped to attack the English flanks and rear but these woods stopped them.

265
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,200
They came head-on into the archers and into as many as 80,000 arrows in a minute.

266
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,040
It was a hopeless venture but the French knights were very brave.

267
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,800
Their leader ran right onto a stake.

268
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,640
He was thrown off his horse, onto the ground, where an archer

269
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,120
knifed him as he lay helpless.

270
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,600
Then, the French problems began.

271
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,600
The surviving horses were maddened by arrows,

272
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,440
and galloped full-tilt into the mass of dismounted men-at-arms,

273
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,800
causing chaos and throwing the first French line into a confusion

274
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,480
from which it never recovered.

275
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,200
The first great block of French men-at-arms, about 8,000 strong,

276
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,320
came on into a blizzard of arrows.

277
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,760
They were tightly packed.

278
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,120
Knights who weren't hit fell over those who were.

279
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,680
The French collided with Henry's line about here.

280
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,240
What happened then is best summed up as bloody murder.

281
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,360
Men hacked and stabbed at each other as long as their strength lasted.

282
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,200
At this point, the archers joined in, bounding in from the flanks,

283
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,320
to ply sword and dagger with deadly effect.

284
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,560
The first block of French men-at-arms was driven back onto the second.

285
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,200
It was more like a Hillsborough-type disaster than a battle,

286
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,400
with knights being crushed to death.

287
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,480
The carnage on the battlefield wasn't the end of the slaughter.

288
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Hundreds of French prisoners were taken during the battle.

289
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,120
Late in the afternoon, a few French knights and peasants attacked Henry's baggage train.

290
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,560
Fearing the prisoners might revolt in the confusion, Henry ordered their execution.

291
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,240
200 archers butchered many captives using knife and axe.

292
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
Later, the wounded had their throats cut.

293
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,520
No-one knows how many Frenchmen died, but there were at least 6,000.

294
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,320
Most of them were stripped of armour and valuables and buried in huge grave pits.

295
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,440
Henry had won a stunning victory

296
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,280
that further strengthened his claim to the throne of France.

297
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,920
The French king, Charles VI, agreed he should succeed him when he died.

298
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,360
But Henry died first - six weeks before Charles.

299
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,680
His victory never quite delivered what he wanted.
