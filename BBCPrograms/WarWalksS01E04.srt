1
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,840
The First World War was so terrible that it haunts us, even 80 years on.

2
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,560
Of all its battles, something is especially dreadful about the Somme.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,280
Its first day was the bloodiest in British history.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,240
The battle was fought from a bright July to a bitter November.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,360
On average, 3 lives were lost for every 12 inches of ground gained.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,240
It's easy to understand why, when you walk over the uplands above the River Somme.

7
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,000
These open, rolling slopes were swept by machine guns and shellfire.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,640
The lethal evidence of war still lies in the fields of the Somme.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,960
A bomb disposal team is on standby to collect what the ploughs turn up.

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,720
Last year it was 90 tons, and this year will be much the same.

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,520
One and three quarter million shells were fired by the British

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,160
in the first week of the campaign.

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,960
A third of them didn't explode and lie here still.

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,920
IN FRENCH:

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,560
It's all right for the professionals to handle these shells, but the public should leave them well alone.

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,120
Like the best French wines,

17
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,240
fused explosive doesn't travel well.

18
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,960
The best place to start a tour of the Somme is Albert.

19
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,240
80 years ago, it was just 4 miles behind the British front line,

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,840
and was transformed from a sleepy market town into a transit camp for the army.

21
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,680
The Germans shelled the town's basilica because it was an artillery spotting post.

22
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Virgin Mary fell from her pedestal.

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,400
80 years later, she's back on top.

24
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,960
The town's fortunes have risen with her. Albert has finally profited from the war - as a tourist centre.

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,600
This is a very big church for a very small town.

26
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Albert had been a pilgrimage centre in the Middle Ages, but somehow it never quite caught on.

27
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,360
In 1916, though, there were British pilgrims here aplenty.

28
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Some were marching along this road, going up to the front line only a couple of miles away.

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,440
Others came out of the line hunting for omelettes, chips and vin blanc.

30
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,280
I think I'll follow their example!

31
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,000
# Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war!

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,560
# What do we want with eggs and ham?

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,080
# When we've got plum and apple jam... #

34
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,000
One of the pleasures of a town like Albert is ogling the patisserie.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Sticky delights were an impossible dream to soldiers going up to the line in 1916.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,200
They lived on things like bully beef, McConachie's meat stew, hardtack biscuits,

37
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
and ever-present plum and apple jam.

38
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,160
This Roman road slashes across the battlefield.

39
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,520
It runs ten miles from Albert, held by the British, to Bapaume, in German hands.

40
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,600
The British hoped to clear this relatively easily

41
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,800
and push on to Bapaume to use their cavalry.

42
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,920
It turned out to be the longest ten miles in British military history.

43
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,880
By early 1916,

44
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,440
the war had fossilised into a line from Switzerland to the North Sea.

45
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Britain and France planned to advance,

46
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,720
but the French were attacked at Verdun, so Britain led the offensive.

47
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,680
This preserved trench gives a good feel for what trenches were like in 1916.

48
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,360
They were dug zigzag, with bays and traverses, to prevent a shell burst from going all the way along.

49
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,880
They'd have been deeper then, and men would have walked on duckboards in the bottom to try and keep dry.

50
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,560
To see the enemy, they'd step up onto a fire step...and look over.

51
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,720
The British planned to smash their way out of the trench war.

52
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
They gathered 1,500 guns of every calibre.

53
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:19,600
The week-long bombardment before the attack was the most awesome in the history of war up to that time.

54
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,960
The Western Front was laced with barbed wire. There were great belts of it in front of the trenches,

55
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,200
strung between these pickets, which are still some of the most durable features of the landscape.

56
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,240
The British bombardment had been designed to cut the German wire.

57
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,840
But too much of it remained intact.

58
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,360
News that the wire wasn't being cut quickly reached the British command. But the reports were largely ignored.

59
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,320
The attack timetable overruled reality, and bombardment continued.

60
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Professor Westmann was a German medical officer in the front line.

61
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,240
- GERMAN ACCENT: 
- Seven days and seven nights.

62
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,080
Soldiers in the bunkers became hysterical.

63
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,800
They wanted to run out

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,240
and fights developed to keep them in the comparative safety of our deep bunkers.

65
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,040
We had nothing to eat and nothing to drink,

66
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,680
but constantly shell after shell burst upon us.

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
The sound and fury of the guns drove many to the edge of despair.

68
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
But it didn't kill them.

69
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,320
Most British shells were absolutely no use against deep German dugouts.

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,880
They were immaculately prepared, supported with timber, and some even had wood panelling.

71
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,400
This one has collapsed, 80 years after it was first dug, after years of having tractors driven over it.

72
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,920
The British didn't rely on guns alone.

73
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,000
The Somme was a scene of underground war. As a prelude to the assault,

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the British dug tunnels to lay 19 mines beneath key German strong points.

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Today, their craters still scar the landscape.

76
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,920
This is the largest of them - Lochnagar Crater.

77
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,040
It took 66,000lbs of explosive to make this hole.

78
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,480
Most of the mines were blown at 7.28, 2 minutes before the main attack began,

79
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,040
in what was then the largest ever man-made sound.

80
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:51,160
They killed hundreds of Germans, but they didn't solve the infantry's real problems.

81
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,920
The mines only dealt with a small part of the German defences.

82
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,960
They also signalled that the attack, long expected, was about to begin.

83
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,000
When the British advanced, the guns fired onto German reserve positions,

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,440
allowing front-line troops to leave their bunkers.

85
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,000
Machine gunners crawled out of the bunkers,

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,920
dirty, full of blood from the blood of their fallen comrades,

87
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,320
and opened up terrific fire.

88
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,200
This piece of precision machinery

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,440
meant death for thousands of British soldiers that bright summer's morning.

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,480
It's the German 1908 machine gun. Although it's heavy -

91
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,720
it takes two men to comfortably lift it - the Germans had plenty of time to get it up from their bunkers

92
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,560
and set it up in the wreckage of trenches or in shell holes.

93
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,360
It has a range of over 2,000 yards,

94
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,200
and in country like this the machine gun is king.

95
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,720
'Amateur historian Bill Turner knows the Somme better than most.

96
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,640
'He has a passionate interest in the Accrington Pals,'

97
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,560
a battalion of volunteers raised in Lancashire in 1914.

98
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,960
The Accringtons were recruited by the town's Lord Mayor in response to Lord Kitchener's call for men.

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,240
There were dozens of similar battalions waiting in the Somme trenches on 1st July, 1916.

100
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,640
They believed their country needed them. They also believed in the preparations made by high command.

101
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,040
Bill, there's not much left of it, but this was the front-line trench form which the Accringtons attacked.

102
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes, it was indeed.

103
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,440
The Charlie company were at this end of the trench, and it was the starting point for the whole attack.

104
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
- What sort of men were they? 
- Oh, they represented the community.

105
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,880
They were miners, engineers, textile workers, office workers, shop assistants,

106
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,920
young boys who should have been at home with their mothers.

107
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,920
There were family men who had several children.

108
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,080
- What did they expect from the battle of the Somme?
- I think they thought

109
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,720
it would be the turning point.

110
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,360
All they'd enlisted and trained for would culminate in the battle, ending the war.

111
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
The Accringtons were on the northern flank of the main British attack.

112
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,520
All along the 18-mile front,

113
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,360
the first wave of 60,000 men was waiting for the signal to go.

114
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,400
The morning of July 1st was clear and bright.

115
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,760
The sun glinted off tin triangles the troops wore on their backs so planes could track their progress.

116
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
They were already tired by the time they got this far.

117
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Thank you.

118
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,640
Yes, they would be exhausted.

119
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,200
They'd travelled seven miles overnight. They were heavily laden.

120
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,240
- What sort of things were they carrying?
- They had full pack on.

121
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,280
Some would have a shovel, some a pick.

122
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,080
The intention was not so much to attack.

123
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,440
They would be going across, really, to consolidate the German trenches,

124
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,960
hopefully destroyed by shellfire.

125
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:52,080
We did think that when the time came, there would be nothing alive when we went over there.

126
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,240
We'd never been over. We didn't know what to expect. We looked forward to it!

127
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,080
We expected that when we did go over the top, we would find it just a cakewalk.

128
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,560
As soon as men left the trenches, they came under fire.

129
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,840
They were trying to get through the gaps in the wire and the German fire concentrated on those gaps.

130
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,840
The four lines never really got off to a start from here on.

131
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,840
The attack had really failed.

132
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,880
The German machine gunners had our line taped to an inch,

133
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
and our fellas, they just went down

134
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
like sickled grain.

135
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,880
We got halfway across and then the two machine guns found us.

136
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,720
The air was full of bullets. One went between my fingers.

137
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,560
The bullet's there before you know. Then you see the bleeding and feel the pain in your leg.

138
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Not a living soldier was to be seen.

139
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,240
There was dead and dying all over the place.

140
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,280
This is as far as many of them got -

141
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
just 100 yards from the front line.

142
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,960
Almost 600 of the 720-strong battalion

143
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,480
were killed or wounded in just 20 minutes.

144
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Today, the cemeteries run along the British front line,

145
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,080
where so many soldiers were killed before they'd even seen their enemy.

146
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,280
20 minutes' brisk walk from where the Accringtons went over the top,

147
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,240
the Lancashire Fusiliers were waiting their turn.

148
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,680
Overnight, they'd crept into a sunken lane in no-man's-land, 100 yards from the Germans.

149
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,200
An army cameraman filmed them in the lane before they left its shelter.

150
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,760
They were shelled just after first light. But at 7.30, whistles blew and they went over the top.

151
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,560
There were German machine guns in the wood edge, more on the far slope.

152
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,040
At this range, the gunners could scarcely miss.

153
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,680
The attackers were stopped dead as soon as they crossed the lip of the sunken road.

154
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,720
A few wounded survivors crashed back into it. Corporal George Ashurst tells us what it was like.

155
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,920
"Picking myself up and looking round, my God, what a sight. The whole road was strewn with dead and dying men.

156
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,880
"Some were talking deliriously, others calling for help and water."

157
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,920
The Fusiliers' commanding officer, Colonel Martin Magniac, was here.

158
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,720
He sent a message to headquarters, telling them what had happened.

159
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,280
"I tried two advances. Both failed. We are mown down by machine-gun fire and only get a few yards beyond road.

160
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,320
"If you wish, I will of course attack."

161
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Brigade HQ cancelled the next attack, but, tragically, Magniac had already ordered his reserve forward.

162
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Only one officer and three men got even this far.

163
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,760
Along two-thirds of the British front line, the story was the same.

164
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:31,320
Confused reports came back, and fresh troops were thrown in to reinforce failure.

165
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,160
Only in the south did some divisions reach their objectives,

166
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,800
and speedy German counter-attacks made some gains difficult to hold.

167
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,280
Some attackers were killed outright.

168
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,120
Others were hit and took refuge in shell holes like this.

169
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,760
They carried field dressings.

170
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,600
These were really pads of gauze with cords to tie them on -

171
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,280
pathetically inadequate for many wounds.

172
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:11,840
Some wounded managed to crawl back to British lines after dark. Others were dragged to safety by mates.

173
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,680
But many simply bled to death here.

174
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,720
Often, they were in shell holes like this for days.

175
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,600
'The luckier ones made their way to field dressing stations, sometimes in ruined houses near the front.

176
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,120
'One was in the cellar of a house in Auchonvillers.

177
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,560
'It's now owned by a British woman, Avril Williams.'

178
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,160
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello. Come in.

179
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,720
I've come to see your wonderful cellar, if I may.

180
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,840
- Avril, this was a dressing station in 1916.
- Mm-hm.
- How do you know?

181
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Because of the graffiti that was left. It shows stretcher-bearers.

182
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,160
There's one here - J Gay, 1st 4th Ox/Bucks.

183
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,800
- There's a carved stretcher-bearer in the stone, so it had to be a stretcher-bearers' post.
- Let's look.

184
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Down here we have a signalman, JE Hargreaves, 1918, Oswaldtwistle.

185
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,760
And there's his flags. It's the only 1918 one we have.

186
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,800
- Have you found anything else down here?
- Yes. Lots of bits and pieces.

187
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,440
We found bullets of all countries.

188
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,840
Buttons. We found coins - English.

189
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,080
This was on the floor, obviously to stop them sinking in the mud.

190
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,080
We found two cap badges. That's the Canterburies'.

191
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,960
- They retook Auchonvillers in 1918. 
- Yes.

192
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,320
And then we found these - morphine.

193
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,640
- We found seven. 
- It's a morphine ampoule?
- Mm-hm. 
- How was that administered?

194
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,280
Apparently, it was too big a dose for one person,

195
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,320
so as the stretcher-bearers brought the injured up...

196
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,680
If they had no chance, and they were in terrible pain, they went along the line pushing a little in.

197
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,720
- Pushing it in?
- They'd take off the top and put it into a needle. They were huge needles.

198
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,720
They'd go along, injecting as they went, to ease the pain and get them on their way.

199
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,840
By nightfall on the 1st of July, the British army had suffered 57,000 casualties,

200
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,320
about half the men who'd taken part in the attack.

201
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,960
Many were from the Pals' battalions.

202
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,640
Men from the same streets and factories who'd joined up together had died together. In return,

203
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,800
they'd taken a few miles of German front line - more a devil's bargain

204
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,520
than the breakthrough Britain had hoped for.

205
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,800
But the Battle of the Somme was just beginning.

206
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,720
It took two days for the full scale of the disaster to filter through to British commanders.

207
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,760
It was longer still before the British public realised what had happened.

208
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,760
But there were sections of the line where gains could be exploited.

209
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Kitchener's volunteer army had been terribly bloodied, but it had learnt lessons. Over the coming months,

210
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,040
thousands more British soldiers were poured into the struggle, until more than a million had been committed.

211
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,800
In war, it's often the simplest things that work best.

212
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,400
Many British commanders had learnt from the 1st of July

213
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,240
and argued that a night attack would make those German machine guns much less effective.

214
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,760
On the night of 13th-14th July,

215
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,600
British troops assembled in a valley at the foot of the German-held ridge.

216
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,480
They were guided into position by thousands of yards of white tape,

217
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,360
laboriously surveyed in by map and compass.

218
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,160
The infantry waited in no-man's-land

219
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,320
while a lightning bombardment hit German positions, then they attacked.

220
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,360
In the darkness, the German machine gunners were blind

221
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,080
and the British were able to get through the wire with few casualties. The attack was a success.

222
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,480
Throughout July, the British crept on inch by bloody inch.

223
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
But they were stalled here

224
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,320
for much of the summer.

225
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,240
These Somme woods are still gashed by trench systems and speckled by shell holes.

226
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,760
In summer 1916, they were full of undergrowth. British shelling had felled trees, to worsen the tangle.

227
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,120
They were ideal nests for their German defenders.

228
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,240
Each of the Somme woods had its own mythology. Mametz Wood had bitter memories for the 38th Welsh Division.

229
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,080
Delville Wood was known with reason as Devil's Wood.

230
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,760
And then there was High Wood, ghastly by day, ghostly by night - the rottenest place on the Somme.

231
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,720
If the woods proved a nightmare,

232
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,960
the heavily fortified villages and hamlets were no better.

233
00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:00,040
Some of the heaviest fighting on the Somme took place along the Roman road from Albert to Bapaume.

234
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,080
The villages today show few signs of the intensity of the fighting.

235
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,560
But every cellar was a strong point, every open courtyard a deathtrap.

236
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,600
There's evidence enough stacked in one front garden -

237
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:22,120
thousands of shrapnel shells fired by the British in an attempt to dislodge resolute German defenders.

238
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,600
Pozieres, on the Roman road in the very centre of the battlefield,

239
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,640
was reduced to stinking rubble by bombardments in July and August.

240
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,480
All this was built up after the war.

241
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,360
It's typical of the ghastly slogging match that the Somme had now become

242
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:49,480
that it took the Australians, newly arrived on this front, 23,000 men to take this village.

243
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,520
Many Australians were deeply disillusioned.

244
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,920
One wrote that he'd had enough of British staff, methods and bungling.

245
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,640
The growing infantry casualties on the Somme were becoming intolerable.

246
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,080
The British desperately needed something that could blunt the devastating power of the machine gun.

247
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,920
They pinned hopes on a lumbering hunk of metal almost as dangerous to its drivers as to the enemy.

248
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Early on the morning of the 15th of September, tanks went into action here for the first time ever.

249
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,720
The first was used to clear a German trench on the edge of Delville Wood.

250
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,320
Four in High Wood fared badly amongst tree stumps.

251
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,720
Many more swayed and clattered over this bare, open crest behind me,

252
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,560
making for the village of Flers.

253
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,280
A British pilot looked down on the scene and said,

254
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,880
"A tank is walking up the main street of Flers with the British army cheering behind it."

255
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,520
But the cheers faded as the tanks proved themselves to be too slow and mechanically unreliable

256
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,440
to make the war-winning breakthrough.

257
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,880
Heavy autumn rains turned the chalky soil of the Somme into a quagmire.

258
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,840
The dream of a breakthrough became as distant as the memory of summer.

259
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,000
The battle squelched to a halt in November, with the British still short of Bapaume.

260
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,960
They were dug in on these bare ridges, with the wind keening across.

261
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,720
All around, a landscape of wrecked tanks and corpses.

262
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,120
Life in these trenches was close to unbearable.

263
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,160
It was two miles to carry stretcher cases to the nearest light railway.

264
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,360
The army was losing 1,000 men a week with frostbite and trench foot.

265
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,200
The Thiepval memorial dominates the skyline of the Somme.

266
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,520
On it are inscribed more than 70,000 names.

267
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,000
These are the men who have no known graves.

268
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,480
These great pillars are a monument

269
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,600
to the old world of brass bands and cricket fields, pithead cottages and broad acres.

270
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,560
Among the writers, artists and musicians commemorated here is George Butterworth,

271
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,480
whose music and songs have become an epitaph to the lost age.

272
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:09,600
Those whose bodies WERE recovered lie in 188 British and Commonwealth cemeteries throughout the region.

273
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,280
It's impossible to visit the Somme without being struck by the sheer scale of the human sacrifice.

274
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Some of these soldiers died in July, expecting a quick breakthrough.

275
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,840
Others died in a muddy slog that went on till November.

276
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,680
Even now, historians still argue about what it all achieved.

277
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,800
The Allies had suffered over 600,000 casualties, the Germans perhaps more.

278
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,720
But the British army had lost something else - its innocence.

279
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,480
It had lost its belief that the power of patriotism and the human spirit

280
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,080
could triumph over the machine gun and the shell.
