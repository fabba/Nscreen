00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,840
In 1940, the Germans launched one of history's most dynamic invasions,

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,080
unleashing a lightning war that simply overwhelmed Allied forces.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,680
This is the story of that invasion,

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,280
and of how a small British force, fighting near the French town of Arras, almost threw it off course.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,480
The First World War left deep scars on France.

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,160
A third of young Frenchmen had been killed or crippled. Huge tracts of French territory had been devastated.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,600
Frenchmen were determined never to be invaded again.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,640
In 1930, they had begun work on a fortified barrier, named after the then War Minister, Andre Maginot.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,480
This fort, with its barbed wire and steel, has changed very little.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:19,160
A line of forts like this covered 90 miles of the most vulnerable area of the Franco-German border.

11
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,040
But they stopped short at the frontier with Belgium, France's ally.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,480
These Maginot Line forts

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,520
were the cutting edge of 1930s' technology.

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,560
They had underground barracks, hospitals and even electric railways.

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,240
They were equipped for a variety of threats.

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,280
This is a twin 8mm machine gun to deal with infantry.

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,240
If tanks appeared,

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,800
this 37mm anti-tank gun could be swung forward on a rail, through this armoured shutter.

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,760
The Press called this the shield of France.

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,520
But a shield can be moved. This steel and concrete can't.

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,160
By 1940, war had moved on and made this increasingly irrelevant.

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,000
The Germans had used new tactics in Poland the year before.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,840
They brought tanks and close-support aircraft together on the battlefield in a new form of war.

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
It was called Blitzkrieg.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,680
On May 10th 1940, Germany invaded Holland and Belgium.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,520
The Allies sent the best of their forces to intercept them,

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,560
thinking this was the main German attack.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,000
It wasn't.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
The Germans had a more daring plan.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,000
They would attack the weak link between the main Allied army and the Maginot Line,

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,440
by going through the Ardennes Forest and across the River Meuse at Sedan.

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,200
The French regarded the Ardennes as virtually impassable,

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
so the attack would be a surprise.

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,120
General Guderian's three Panzer divisions attacked Sedan on 13th May.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,400
2,000 of Guderian's vehicles were stacked up on this road, waiting to cross.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,440
German aircraft and artillery had pounded French defences all day.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,800
It was the heaviest concentration of air power ever.

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,840
MUSIC: "Carmina Burana" by Orff

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,560
As German aircraft bombed the French,

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,400
tanks, artillery and anti-tank guns, firing from across the Meuse,

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,120
pounded the concrete bunkers housing the defenders of Sedan.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,560
The 88mm gun did this damage.

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,560
It was an anti-aircraft gun but was used very effectively against bunkers and tanks.

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,280
At 3pm, the barrage lifted, and Colonel Balck's First Rifle Regiment crossed the river in assault boats.

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
French bunkers were back from the water,

46
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,760
so the Germans secured a bridgehead quite easily.

47
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,880
But the French had blown up all the bridges, so the Germans couldn't get tanks over until they built new ones.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,040
The engineers set to work, building bridges under heavy fire,

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,640
allowing German tanks and infantry to cross the river within hours.

50
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,920
The defenders of Sedan found the odds stacked against them.

51
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,320
This bunker is pretty rudimentary compared with the Maginot Line.

52
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,360
In 1940, it wasn't even finished.

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,640
As nobody expected the Germans to come this way, these positions were held by over-age reservists.

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Despite dive-bombing and shelling, the men here fought till German infantry burst in.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,960
Then the little garrison of ten men

56
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,480
was taken out and shot.

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
At the heart of Sedan is one of the largest castles in Europe,

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,480
but medieval stone was no defence against three Panzer divisions.

59
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
This part of the town fell easily.

60
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,520
For the third time in 70 years, the Germans had taken Sedan.

61
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,040
Jacques Rousseau has lived in the town all his life.

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,120
On 15th May, two days after the Sedan crossing,

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,760
the German advance was taking shape.

64
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,800
First, the motorcycle reconnaissance, then the tanks, and miles behind, marching to catch up, the infantry,

65
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
still well on the other side of the Meuse.

66
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,920
In the village of La Horgne,

67
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,480
this 20th-century armoured advance bumped into something out of the Napoleonic Wars.

68
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,120
La Horgne was held by two regiments of spahi -

69
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,040
French North-African cavalry.

70
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,560
They had horses,

71
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,200
carried sabres, carbines and had a few anti-tank guns.

72
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,440
They held the village in a desperate day's fighting.

73
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,560
Colonel Balck, one of the German commanders, considered it one of the hardest day's fighting of his career.

74
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,440
The spahi lost 610 men,

75
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,480
including both regimental commanders killed.

76
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,200
These Moroccan and Algerian troopers lie in French soil.

77
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a cruel irony that their sons may have fought for independence AGAINST France only ten years on.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,600
The biggest danger to the Germans

79
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,520
was that the Allies would get between their armour, forging ahead,

80
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,120
and the infantry miles behind.

81
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,640
Guderian had already been in trouble with his superiors for moving too fast.

82
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,320
On 17th May, here at Montcornet,

83
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,840
a few dozen French tanks under Colonel de Gaulle jabbed into the flank of the German line of advance.

84
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,880
They shot up German trucks before they ran out of momentum and petrol.

85
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,680
It was an indication of how vulnerable the Germans were

86
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,040
and of what might have been achieved, had the Allied commanders been able to mount a co-ordinated attack.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,040
Once they reached these straight roads across northern France, the Germans fairly clipped along.

88
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,680
Almost nothing was in their way.

89
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:10,520
Captain von Kielmansegg of First Panzer Division described that odd vacuum behind the Panzer divisions -

90
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,560
"In this peaceful landscape, human beings are absent.

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,280
"Everything is dead and empty. Not even the old people have remained."

92
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,360
The German plan was working brilliantly.

93
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,960
Blitzkrieg was as much about psychology as about fighting.

94
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,880
The Panzers were moving so fast that the Allies were stunned,

95
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,400
unable to react effectively.

96
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,440
By the time they planned a counterattack,

97
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,480
the Germans were halfway to the Channel.

98
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,960
But most of the Allied army was still in Belgium.

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,480
At last, amid hesitation and misunderstanding,

100
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,920
a small British force was sent to counterattack the Germans at Arras.

101
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,600
Arras had been ruined in the First World War.

102
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,280
Re-building was barely complete

103
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,320
when, in May 1940, it was bombed.

104
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,320
SOPRANO SINGS LIEDER

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,520
German dive bombers -

106
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,680
a terrifying part of the campaign - set fire to parts of the town.

107
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,280
This World War One memorial was hit by bombs that destroyed the station.

108
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:04,120
There was only a tiny British garrison here. Most of the British Army was in the north, in Belgium.

109
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:17,040
The British Army had been in France since September 1939, but few of its men had seen any action.

110
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,840
Britain's main tank was the Matilda.

111
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,680
It was slow-moving, as it was made to be used with infantry.

112
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,440
But most of the infantry hadn't seen a tank, let alone trained with one.

113
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,680
This is one of the few surviving specimens of the infantry tank, Mark One, known as the Matilda.

114
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,520
It lives in the tank museum at Bovington.

115
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,360
It's cramped, slow, poorly armed but heavily armoured.

116
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,400
Not the ideal thing in which to take on a Panzer division.

117
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,480
Peter Vaux fought at Arras and remembers all too well the shortcomings of the Matilda.

118
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,080
What's it like seeing one of these?

119
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,800
I never thought I'd see one again.

120
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,240
We had 58 at Arras, and we left most behind.

121
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,280
It was produced in 1938 to a budget of £11,000.

122
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,760
The requirement was to have a slow-moving tank. God knows it was, at 8mph!

123
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,520
It was to be thickly armoured.

124
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,080
You have a look at the thickness of this. You've got 60mm there...

125
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,160
and on there and the turret... Even more in places.

126
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,880
- Two-man crew?
- A commander up there and a driver down here.

127
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,480
The commander was very busy.

128
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,680
He had to command his tank and fire that gun.

129
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
It was a difficult gun to fire.

130
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,880
He had to operate the radio at the back.

131
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,400
To turn the knobs on it,

132
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,400
he had to lie on his stomach with his feet at the driver's back.

133
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,000
That was very hard to do in battle.

134
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,320
- This running gear looks very exposed. 
- All this, very vulnerable indeed.

135
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
I saw one tank in the battle

136
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,760
that had had this suspension unit completely blown off.

137
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,800
And yet it was hobbling along.

138
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,360
Of course, if this was broken, the tank was crippled.

139
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,880
Here we have the engine.

140
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,000
A straightforward Ford V8 engine from a car.

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,960
It constantly broke down.

142
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,720
That was the big weakness. To mend it, you had to open these things, which was difficult under fire.

143
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,920
- So, well-armoured, poorly armed... 
- Well-armoured.

144
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,560
Stupidly armed with one machine gun.

145
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,000
But their anti-tank guns couldn't do US any harm in this, either.

146
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
Only the big guns blew us to pieces.

147
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,320
German officers since have told me

148
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,200
that they were amazed at how their anti-tank shells bounced off this.

149
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,560
Troops and tanks going to Arras had a hellish journey from Belgium,

150
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,600
on roads made perilous by German dive bombers.

151
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,840
The roads were choked...

152
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,160
with Belgian and French refugees crossing northern France,

153
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,560
fleeing the German advance.

154
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,920
The British were to rendezvous at Vimy Ridge, just north of Arras.

155
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,800
Most arrived exhausted and ill-prepared for the battle.

156
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm up on Vimy Ridge, amid trenches that date from the First World War.

157
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,760
These trees were to commemorate Canadians lost during the war.

158
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Many died capturing the ridge in 1917.

159
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,760
Some of the British who fought at Arras in 1940

160
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,880
got some sleep here the night before the battle.

161
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,920
It must have been eerie, on the eve of their first battle,

162
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,800
for them to spend the night in First World War trenches.

163
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,400
A British tank officer tells us what it was like -

164
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,920
"I arrived at Petit Vimy exhausted and disorganised.

165
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,760
"I was given a map by my commander and told to follow him.

166
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,280
"The wireless didn't work. There was no tie-up with infantry and no clear orders.

167
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,720
"This was our state as we crossed the start line for our first action.

168
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,320
"It wasn't a very auspicious start."

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,600
# We're gonna hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line

170
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,200
# Have you any dirty washing, mother dear?

171
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,240
# We're gonna hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line

172
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,280
# Cos the washing day is here

173
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,280
# Whether the weather may be wet or fine

174
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,320
# We'll just ramble on without a care

175
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,480
# We're gonna hang out the... #

176
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,000
This abbey in the shadow of Vimy Ridge was ruined in World War One.

177
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,840
On 20th May 1940, the Twelfth Lancers, a British reconnaissance regiment, was here.

178
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,880
The Lancers reported that the Germans had passed along that road

179
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,720
and that the area was stiff with German tanks, infantry and artillery.

180
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,640
But the men had been told to attack the Germans in the Arras area

181
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,680
and had been given the impression that there were very few of them.

182
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:06,120
In fact, the British were throwing a handful of tanks and infantry into this whirlpool of German armour.

183
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,960
The attackers left Vimy Ridge late on the morning of 21st May.

184
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,480
Their plan was simple enough.

185
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,000
There were two columns.

186
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Each consisted of 40 tanks of the Royal Tank Regiment,

187
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,680
Durham Light Infantry and some motorcycle reconnaissance.

188
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:47,680
They planned to go round Arras and not meet any Germans until they were south-west of it.

189
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:55,280
It was hot, and the tanks got ahead of the infantry, who were marching, heavily laden, down this road.

190
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,720
The sight of a First World War cemetery can't have been encouraging.

191
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,400
The Durham Light Infantry in the right-hand column

192
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,040
had fought a small battle and got separated from its tanks

193
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,480
by the time it reached Warlus.

194
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,560
Its leading company pushed on down this road but soon ran into heavy opposition and had to fall back.

195
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:36,880
It's typical of the day's confusion that it was just short of the line where the battle was meant to start.

196
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,920
SOPRANO SINGS LIEDER

197
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,920
Some of the Durhams gathered by this water tower outside the village,

198
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,720
where they were attacked by dive bombers.

199
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:25,040
One of them remembered... "We were subjected to a terrifying aerial attack. Everybody was shattered.

200
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:32,680
"After a few minutes, the officers and NCOs collected themselves and said, 'We must get on with it.'

201
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:40,520
"It was hard to get some men moving. We had to kick them into position, and the effect was considerable."

202
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,560
The Durhams fell back into Warlus. Later that night, they broke out with the help of French tanks.

203
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,600
The survivors were back up on Vimy Ridge by six the next morning.

204
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
The two columns of tanks,

205
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,720
both moving well ahead of their infantry,

206
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,760
ran straight into Seventh Panzer Division.

207
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,000
Its commander was a little-known major general who was soon to spring to prominence in North Africa.

208
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,040
His name was Erwin Rommel.

209
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Late in the afternoon, Rommel arrived in the village of Vailly to find chaos and confusion.

210
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,920
He drove up onto this hillock, where there were some German guns,

211
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,120
only to be attacked by British tanks coming from Arras in the north

212
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,560
and from the west, across the main road.

213
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,360
Rommel galvanised the defence

214
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,400
with the help of his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Most.

215
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,040
"With the enemy tanks so close, only rapid fire from every gun could save the situation.

216
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,880
"All I cared about was to halt the enemy tanks by heavy gunfire.

217
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,920
"The worst seemed to be over, when suddenly Most sank to the ground behind a 20mm anti-aircraft gun.

218
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,160
"He was mortally wounded, and blood gushed from his mouth."

219
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,800
Rommel's personal intervention had checked the attack here,

220
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:44,240
but the British had come within an ace of killing a general who was later to cause them infinite trouble.

221
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,520
The left-hand column, curling round the suburban fringes of Arras, did better.

222
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,360
Its tanks, moving ahead of the infantry, got as far as the level crossing which stood here,

223
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,800
and found it down.

224
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,440
Old habits of peacetime die hard,

225
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,120
and it took some time before an officer summoned up the nerve to crash straight through.

226
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,200
Just over the other side, the tanks ran squarely into a column of German infantry in trucks.

227
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,560
The Germans had nothing to penetrate the armour of British tanks, and dozens were killed or captured.

228
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,400
One British officer said we had a glorious free-for-all...

229
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,040
"I didn't see why we shouldn't go all the way to Berlin."

230
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,920
The British didn't get to Berlin.

231
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:06,240
They got barely another two miles and were stopped here by field guns firing from that ridge.

232
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,280
One officer drove up here and saw 20 tanks lying in this field,

233
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,040
their crews dead beside them or crawling through the grass.

234
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,440
He gunned the wood and saw artillery observers fall out of the trees.

235
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,600
He passed his commanding officer's tank with its side blown in.

236
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,640
He wrote, "Although I didn't know it, the Colonel and his radio operator were dead inside it.

237
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
"This was the high watermark of British success."

238
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
The battle was over.

239
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,840
As night fell, the survivors tried to get back to Vimy Ridge.

240
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,320
But the area was full of Germans, and many British were taken prisoner.

241
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,160
The Royal Tank Regiment lost half its tanks, and nearly half the infantry were killed or wounded.

242
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,800
But the battle shook the Germans.

243
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,320
Rommel reported that he'd been attacked by five divisions.

244
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,760
In reality, the total British strength was less than one.

245
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,360
I'm back up on Vimy Ridge with the First World War memorial behind me.

246
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,800
Most survivors of the Arras battle also ended up here at the end of the day

247
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,440
and were evacuated from Dunkirk.

248
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,280
In simple terms, their attack had failed.

249
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,160
But it sent ripples of alarm throughout the German High Command.

250
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,000
The German commander, von Rundstedt, was seriously worried...

251
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,040
"A critical moment came as my forces had reached the Channel.

252
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,880
"It was caused by a British counter-stroke south of Arras.

253
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,920
"It was feared that the Panzers would be cut off before the infantry had arrived to support them.

254
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,920
"No French counterattacks carried a serious threat like this."

255
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,760
This mood contributed to von Rundstedt's decision to order his armour to halt.

256
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,320
German tanks remained stationary for several crucial days.

257
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,960
This gave the British the chance to mount an evacuation from Dunkirk.

258
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,160
Nearly 340,000 soldiers were taken to safety.

259
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,160
Dunkirk was something of a miracle.

260
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,240
The difficult process of evacuating so many thousands took days.

261
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
The last troops were taken to safety on June 4th,

262
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
leaving the beach strewn with wreckage.

263
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,840
The Channel was Britain's shield against defeat.

264
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,360
It was four long years before British troops returned in strength.

265
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,680
The German invasion had been an extraordinary success.

266
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,480
Some Panzers had fought their way from Sedan to the coast in seven days - a journey of over 200 miles.

267
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:55,800
Yet the Arras attack proved that the Germans were not invincible and that their offensive had entailed risks.

268
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,840
But it was the Allies' tragedy that, mesmerised by Blitzkrieg,

269
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,760
they never managed to turn these risks to their advantage.
