1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,270
Even if you were just colleagues,
there was love, perhaps.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,190
What we will do for
love. Die for it, even.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,990
We do know that she was
investigating something

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,110
and Haider Jamal Abdi may
have been helping her.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,430
I know him. The man on your appeal.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,390
They come in here with their
fake IDs and their licences,

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,990
and I send them away just as quick.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,590
Tom Read, I arrest you for
perverting the course of justice.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,830
CHRISSIE!

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,230
Was there anything,
anything different about her?

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,470
You worked with her that day. You
went for dinner, for Christ's sake.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,110
You must have talked about something.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,670
We worked. We had lunch.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,720
We worked some more. We went for Chinese.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,750
We talked about nothing.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,710
The last time I saw Stevie,

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,910
she said that she... she loved someone.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,500
I thought that someone was...

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,990
She gave me £10,000 that night,
to look after her younger brother.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,830
I think... I think she
knew something was coming.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,870
She asked me if something happened to her,

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,120
to look after Frankie.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,380
Just to go back over again...

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,680
.. you come out of the
Chinese restaurant...

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,030
Yeah.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
After a brief exchange,
she crosses the road.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,790
Did you see who shot her?

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,780
No, my view was obscured by the van.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,640
But you saw the car pull away?

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Yes.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,800
- She crosses the road...
- Do you recall the last thing she said to you?

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
River.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,280
"Screw you, Mr Magoo."

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,960
That's the last thing she said to you?

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,700
I've got blood all over my shirt.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,310
What the hell was she up to?

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,550
She gave you that money, didn't she?

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,590
That's what she was giving you,
outside the restaurant, the 10K?

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,240
She knew something was coming.

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,270
You are caught in what is
known as a paradox, my friend.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,750
The closer you get to the truth,
the further away you'll get from me.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
From who I was.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,940
And then you'll see who I really am.

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,060
Solve this, Magoo, and
you know what happens.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,590
Oh, Inspector.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,630
For the guilty, there is nothing
that gives more masochistic pleasure

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,030
than to retrace one's steps.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,880
To replay the details of
one's most horrific crimes.

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,910
Alas, you could not heave
your heart into your mouth

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
and tell her how you felt that night.

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,940
If only you had taken her in your arms.

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,990
If only.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,440
If only.

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,670
If only.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,350
Then she may still be alive

56
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,270
and somewhere inside of
you would not have died.

57
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,110
But do not be afraid, Inspector.

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,630
She may be gone,

59
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
but I will still be there, for ever...

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,630
.. by your side!

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,270
River, I went through the three key firms

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,750
that Stevie was investigating
in the lead-up to her murder.

63
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,350
- Chrissie not in yet?
- No.

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,510
Office Work Solutions -- an
employment agency in Harrow.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,910
They headhunt and supply
a variety of staff.

66
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,310
Cleaning contracts, mainly.

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,750
The second -- TPA Waste Management.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,790
They provide recycling contracts.

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,950
And the third -- E&F Car
Services, of which Bennigan Cars

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,750
is one of five subsidiary
companies, all providing taxis,

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,750
luxury chauffeurs, a collective
payroll of 1,900 employees.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,230
Drivers, mainly.

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,110
Bennigan Cars has got 76,

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,830
maybe 80 applicants through
in the last 18 months.

75
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
All applying for visas,
rights to stay in the country.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,390
Nearly all had their cases
approved by one judge, Tom Read,

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,230
and then went on to future employment

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,910
in one of those companies.

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,400
- And what links all those
companies is... - E6 Holdings.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,150
I'm trying to get a list

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,870
of all the shareholders, but...

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Michael Bennigan... was on the board.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,300
She was researching
this as far back as 2003.

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,670
Certainly, she's been pulling up
information on Michael Bennigan,

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,260
periodically, over the years.

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,510
It's not enough to arrest him.

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,640
I've applied for a warrant
to get in there and search.

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,230
These companies come under
rigorous legislation.

89
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,630
- They can't just employ illegal...
- Illegal immigrants?

90
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,510
They're not illegal.

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,150
It's a quick fix to get them into work.

92
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,940
He must get something in return.

93
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
I think she sent Haider in...
to see how the system worked.

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,550
Ira, you lead the search.

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,710
I should do that. I know Michael.

96
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,470
You need to deal with Tom.

97
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Find me the links to Stevie's murder.

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,790
Where's Chrissie?

99
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,910
Compassionate leave.

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Are you going to let
her get away with that?

101
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,780
She needs to be here.

102
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,150
I don't know what tea I drink any more.

103
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Tea is tea.

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,670
How did you find me?

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,860
Nina opened the door.

106
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,480
School sent her home.

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,140
I haven't told them where Tom is.

108
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,990
He's always working, anyway.

109
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,510
And they haven't even asked.

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,830
You need to come in.

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,350
- You need to sit in and listen
to Tom's interview. - No. No.

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,230
If I could get Stevie in a room
and find out what she's done,

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,470
what she did, if I could do that, I would.

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,950
I can't, River.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,790
My husband... is sitting in a cell

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,190
four floors below my office.

117
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,230
I can't face anyone. I...

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
Go away.

119
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,790
- Where's your balls?
- When did I ever need balls?!

120
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,430
When did balls ever make
you a better detective?

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,110
In 33 years in the force,
that's what blokes say.

122
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,110
"Where's your balls?" I got where I got.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,430
I did it, and I didn't need
a pair of sodding nuts.

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,580
Now piss off and let me do my shopping.

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,910
Is this really where you want to be?

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,950
This is where I should have been.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,230
This is where I should
have been for 33 years.

128
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,990
But, instead, I've worked and sweated,

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,390
and I've drunk pints with
pissed-up commissioners,

130
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,750
and I've taken shit...
Oh, God, so much shit!

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,230
But the one thing I could
say, through all the losses,

132
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,990
through all the missed
sports days, and the holidays

133
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,430
and the late nights when my kids needed me

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,470
and I was sweating to close a case,

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,070
the one thing I could say
was that it was worth it.

136
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
And now it's not because he's guilty!

137
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,710
He's guilty,

138
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,830
River, and therefore I will
be tarred with the same brush.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,360
33 years, River, and this is
my fucking carriage clock?!

140
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,620
Sorry.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
I hate you.

142
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,430
I hate you for finding him out.

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,420
My fault. Never employ
anyone good at their job.

144
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
I hate you.

145
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
I hate you, I hate you.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,830
We're conducting a search.
Can you please stand up,

147
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,080
away from your desks, please. Thank you.

148
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
- Chrissie...
- I'm humouring River.

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,510
Did you, on November 14th this year,

150
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,550
visit a bank of lockers off Dalston Lane?

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,910
Also on the 4th November,

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,900
the 23rd October, the 7th October...

153
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,870
.. and on three or four other occasions

154
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,510
from September to mid August?

155
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,360
- I haven't been briefed with this...
- Is she here?

156
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,070
Is Chrissie here?

157
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,990
I'll repeat my question.

158
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,750
Did you, on November 14th of this year,

159
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
visit a bank of lockers off Dalston Lane?

160
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,750
- Yes.
- Why did you go there?

161
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,470
- To pick up payments.
- How many?

162
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,750
I don't know. Seven, eight. I lost count.

163
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,990
- What were those payments for?
- I wish to confer with my client.

164
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,120
The person who paid you may
be involved in Stevie's death.

165
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,990
I need to talk to Chrissie.

166
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,590
I need to talk to her first.

167
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,510
She's listening.

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,190
I received a text message.

169
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,670
From who? Was it Michael Bennigan?

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,750
I don't know.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
The request was simple.

172
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,760
There were certain immigration
cases that would come before me.

173
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,480
I was to quickly waive
these cases through.

174
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,990
There were threats...

175
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,670
to reveal certain information.

176
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,860
I refused to respond.

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,630
Then photographs were sent...

178
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,270
of me and others.

179
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,830
Others?

180
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,950
Taken -- clearly illicitly
-- taken at work.

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,150
Compromising photographs.

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,790
Nothing obscene but, to the trained
eye, to those that know me,

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,510
they would confirm...

184
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,960
that I was having affairs.

185
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,520
Affairs? Plural?

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,280
Yes.

187
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,950
I don't see how this
connects to Stevie's death.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,510
Four phone calls, Tom, the last
made on the morning she died.

189
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
- Mm, that doesn't mean...
- The day she was murdered.

190
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,510
She told me that I was to tell Chrissie.

191
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,240
If not, she would talk to
her herself... that day.

192
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,470
Chrissie was already home when I got back.

193
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,990
She'd even cooked dinner.
She never cooks dinner.

194
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,910
And, miraculously, by nine,
all the children had fled,

195
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,720
gone to bed, homework, friends.

196
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,110
Even the dog, even the dog...

197
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
was somewhere else.

198
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,350
But I WAS going to tell her.

199
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,590
I was going to tell her...

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,750
everything... that night.

201
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,630
And then... the phone rings

202
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,680
and it's you, saying that Stevie's dead.

203
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,040
It's the relief, isn't it?

204
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Because now I won't have to tell Chrissie.

205
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,430
I can comfort her...

206
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,190
.. and we can go to bed and cling
to one another and tell one another,

207
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,380
"Thank God we're OK."

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,940
"I love you, too."

209
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,500
Only we don't.

210
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,460
We didn't.

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,540
And I still don't know...

212
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,000
.. if Stevie said anything
to Chrissie at all.

213
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
Charge him!

214
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,750
Yeah.

215
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,590
Oh, God.

216
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,630
Mike's leaving drinks.

217
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,800
Promotion. Criminal Justice
Unit. Haverford West.

218
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,270
You knew.

219
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,390
That's what she wanted
to talk to you about.

220
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
She was talking in riddles. She was upset.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,190
She called me that day and I said...

222
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,710
"We'll talk in the morning,"

223
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,460
and I didn't think anything
of it. I didn't, River.

224
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,640
And then she was dead.

225
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,240
- There you go.
- Thanks.

226
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,150
Yeah, just... just lay it down over there.

227
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,550
Hard drives and files.

228
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,190
Michael Bennigan's lawyer
will contact you directly.

229
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,430
I went through Bennigan's stuff...

230
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,220
and I found some corrupted data.

231
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,190
Look at this.

232
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,710
Uh, it looks like...

233
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,300
someone's tried to delete it.

234
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,080
I'll get tech, to see
if they can clean it up.

235
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
The secrets of the heart are buried deep.

236
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,140
Only time will reveal how
deeply they are sown.

237
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,800
Open it.

238
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
'Put him down, Stevie.'

239
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,710
'Put your boy down!'

240
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,030
'Put your boy down!'

241
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,790
You see, no-one is what
they seem, Inspector.

242
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,340
She didn't want you to
know who she really was.

243
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,120
What to do?

244
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,780
Is the diet going well, then?

245
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,070
I don't get weighed until tomorrow.

246
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,630
You should exercise.

247
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,080
Do you?

248
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,140
Never.

249
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,390
I went to Zumba once.

250
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,750
I walked in and then I
walked back out again.

251
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,270
You needed leggings. I
don't have leggings.

252
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,260
I had my jeans on.

253
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,510
We raided the offices today.

254
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,830
- Frankie...
- I don't know anything.

255
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,820
That was the deal.

256
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,190
Stevie said...

257
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,440
Stevie said, if I work for Michael,
I was to be kept out of it all.

258
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,670
I mean...

259
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,470
You've already given me,

260
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,390
like, 200 quid.

261
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,750
She gave me ten grand for you.

262
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,200
Take it.

263
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,070
You could go somewhere with it.

264
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,880
- I don't have a passport.
- Well, get one.

265
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,380
Travel. Go abroad.

266
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,270
No. You're all right.

267
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,630
- I don't want it.
- Why did she want me to look after you?

268
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't know what she wanted me to do.

269
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,750
How am I meant to help you?

270
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,620
Tell me, Frankie.

271
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,040
I can't sleep in the flat no more.

272
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,460
I can't sleep at home. I can't sleep...

273
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,790
.. anywhere.

274
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,350
I walk around all night, until it's light,

275
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,500
and then I go to work... and I go home.

276
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,840
And, uh...

277
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,680
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm drowning.

278
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,480
Come on. Come on, Frankie.

279
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,030
- Last one in is...
- Chicken!

280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,800
Whoo!

281
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,160
Will your mother be up?

282
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Yeah. Looks like it.

283
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,120
I knew you'd come home.

284
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,060
The colour's drained out of you.

285
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,470
- Thank you. - I heard you
searched Michael's place?

286
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,990
Yeah.

287
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,510
What did you do that for?

288
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Just a part of the ongoing investigation.

289
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,550
Oh.

290
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,990
Right. Do yous want some toast?

291
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
No.

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,110
- How old were you there?
- Oh, about...

293
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,910
about a month.

294
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,110
You were born in Cork?

295
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Me waters broke when we
were staying at me sister's.

296
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,790
And that's you as well?

297
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,780
Our late surprise.

298
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,320
Frankie. Upstairs and get a dry shirt on.

299
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,480
Do it.

300
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,910
He's got some idea about her flat.

301
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,870
Told him we need to sell it.

302
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,310
You can do something with money.

303
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,270
Not bricks and mortar...
and a pasta machine.

304
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,950
Oh, a pasta machine?

305
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,110
You ever known our Stevie make
a bowl of food in her life?

306
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,550
She made good scrambled eggs.

307
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,800
And she could laugh
till she pissed herself.

308
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,280
She was loyal, passionate and true.

309
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,310
And she loved.

310
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,070
But the one person she loved
with everything was that boy.

311
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Why did she love that boy so much, Bridie?

312
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,160
Hello?

313
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Yeah. Yep, I've heard.

314
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,470
I know.

315
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,320
No. Not now, it's not a good time.

316
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,150
Yeah.

317
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,470
OK.

318
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,720
Yes.

319
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,110
'I don't know why you've
brought me here, John.

320
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,720
'Why? Hm?'

321
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,720
'Put him down, Stevie.

322
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
'Put your boy down!

323
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,550
'Frankie.

324
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,510
'Come on! Come here!'

325
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,310
How do you turn that thing off?

326
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,830
Turn it off.

327
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,950
- SIT DOWN!
- Turn it off!

328
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,750
What else are you prepared to lie about?

329
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,470
E6 Holdings.

330
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,990
Do you know the company?

331
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
No comment.

332
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,320
He takes care of you, Michael.
Takes care of you well.

333
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,790
He's been a good friend.

334
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,390
The last thing Stevie asked me to do,

335
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,510
before she died, was
to take care of Frankie.

336
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,960
Her son.

337
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,190
I want a lawyer.

338
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,180
You can have one.

339
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,120
This is just the warm-up chat.

340
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Who was the father?

341
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,950
I didn't ask.

342
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,830
Probably a poke for a pound
round the back of Greens.

343
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,310
She opened her legs for everyone.

344
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,960
Cheap date.

345
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,500
She wanted to flush him away.

346
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Wanted to flush that boy away.

347
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,070
I took him in.

348
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,950
I made him my own.

349
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,470
Kept him on the straight.

350
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,150
Until you let him work for Michael.

351
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,990
Oh, he's a big boy.

352
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,350
Is that why she went in to investigate?

353
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
To protect Frankie?

354
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
No comment.

355
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,480
The night Stevie was murdered,
the car she was shot from...

356
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,580
.. was left at a scrapyard.
It's a blue Mondeo.

357
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,280
Do you recognise this car?

358
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,710
- No?
- No. No.

359
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,230
But you know who dumped it.

360
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,800
You dumped it, Bridie.

361
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,150
A figure wearing that coat...

362
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,630
was seen ditching it at a scrapyard,

363
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,790
90 minutes after she was shot.

364
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,870
Five foot seven, five foot eight.

365
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,320
About your height, Bridie.

366
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,470
Oh, is it March?

367
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,430
When the mad hares
breed? Because you're mad!

368
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,240
Madness can bring its own
kind of clarity, Bridie.

369
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,620
Did you shoot your own daughter?

370
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,180
Did Michael kill her?

371
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,750
Did Michael kill Stevie?

372
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,680
No comment.

373
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,950
Is that the cleaned-up files?

374
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,270
Yeah.

375
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,950
Found something?

376
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,600
Wait...

377
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,990
Easy, Tonto.

378
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,670
The one thing,

379
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,710
the one thing you asked was
that they keep Frankie out of it.

380
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,830
- But they didn't, did they?
- River. Please.

381
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,480
I'm doing this for Frankie.

382
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,390
Some find them a little macabre...

383
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,270
but I like them.

384
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,390
You know, slavery existed even
before the Roman Occupation,

385
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,230
although the true pioneers
of the English slave trade

386
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,360
didn't really kick in
until the mid-16th century.

387
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,870
When Eric and I first
arrived in England, it was,

388
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,830
"No Irish, no coloureds,"
when you tried to rent a room.

389
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,480
You had to fight to get
anywhere in this country.

390
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,350
So, I like to think that, uh...

391
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,990
.. I'm doing my bit for the
next generation coming in.

392
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,510
I'll say the same in court.

393
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,430
I was looking at some
CCTV from that night.

394
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,470
You were right -- we did
have that car out the back.

395
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,190
Everything is digital now, huh?

396
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,910
You paid to have Haider killed.

397
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,700
Did you do the same with Stevie?

398
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,550
You see, that's my point.

399
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,100
You can never underestimate
the power of family.

400
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,550
Stevie never really understood that.

401
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,400
She always put truth before blood.

402
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,670
She was throwing around the threats.

403
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,190
Bridie and Jimmy and Frankie were upset.

404
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,750
I mean, I was willing to let it pass.

405
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,470
I mean, that girl was like a...

406
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,020
I loved her... more than my own.

407
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,870
Yeah, Stevie had a fight with Bridie,

408
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,350
threatened to tell Frankie the truth.

409
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,150
When the truth is, the only
mother who will protect him now

410
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,590
is the one who brought him up.

411
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,520
It would have devastated Frankie
to know who his mother really was.

412
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,160
That's why someone... had to stop her.

413
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,190
He didn't need much persuading.
He was in a terrible way!

414
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,230
He'd been on the lash with Jimmy.

415
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,590
He failed to get it up
with some little tart

416
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,840
that Jimmy found for
him. Came crying to me.

417
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,990
Frankie came to realise the error
of his ways... in confiding in her.

418
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,040
He knew the damage that she could do.

419
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,670
He told me that Stevie
was going to her boss.

420
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,920
He told Stevie things about my business.

421
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Things he really shouldn't have said.

422
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,750
Now, I knew that the truth would
come out -- the whole truth --

423
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,840
the good and the bad. I
couldn't let Frankie know that.

424
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,110
It's a terrible thing to know,

425
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,830
that you were destined for a toilet pan.

426
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,790
Because there is nothing more
precious than human life.

427
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
A lesson, sadly, Stevie learned too late.

428
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,110
Ha-ha!

429
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,070
That's my Monica's girls!

430
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,260
Ah!

431
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Who was the father?

432
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Christ...

433
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
She was 14.

434
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,830
You're a monster.

435
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,830
Monsters are for children.

436
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,220
We're all grown-ups here.

437
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,150
I'd hoped employing Tom Read

438
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,990
might have provided a few insurances,

439
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,640
but in the absence of those...

440
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,310
Do you really want
Frankie to know the truth?

441
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,230
The whole truth?

442
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,510
That boy won't come back from that.

443
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,430
Prison?

444
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,080
It would break Stevie's heart.

445
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,400
I will leave it... in your hands.

446
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,950
We went for a drink, I
got pissed too quick.

447
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,390
We went home and we... we watched TV.

448
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,030
Frankie, you're lying.

449
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,390
You saying I'm lying?

450
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,230
No, Bridie, I'm saying he's your son...

451
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,710
The person to fear the most is...

452
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,190
.. and a mother protects her son.

453
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,470
.. the one to whom you
gave all your trust.

454
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,830
If only you had replied
to Stevie's question.

455
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,430
We talk, she crosses the road...

456
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,270
If only you had taken her in your arms...

457
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,110
.. she turns her head... and
there's a look of recognition.

458
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,990
- If only. - She knew something
was coming. - If only.

459
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,240
If only.

460
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,230
You want to know who needs
protecting? Frankie.

461
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,670
Do you blame yourself?

462
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,110
I should have sensed something was wrong.

463
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,080
I ignored it, River, I did, I
ignored it, and you did, too.

464
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
You don't know what to do.

465
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,860
Sorry.

466
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,990
Sorry.

467
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,990
You're late.

468
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,240
I am indeed late, yeah.

469
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,320
Ask me why I bothered to
come again, after last time.

470
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,840
Why did you come back?

471
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,640
And it wasn't because I
missed your sorry faces!

472
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,750
You want to hear my story?

473
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,310
I'm six years old, I'm sitting
on a bus together with my mother.

474
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
It's the last stop.

475
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,440
My grandmother's house is the
last stop and it's a beautiful day.

476
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,480
And my grandmother says to me,
"Boy, go and swim in the lake."

477
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,820
And I swim and I swim and I swim.

478
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,200
And when I come back, my mother is gone.

479
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,670
Has got back on that bus and driven away.

480
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,990
And I don't see her again for eight years.

481
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,990
Eight years.

482
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,510
And when I do see her again,
I am 14 and she's stoned.

483
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,710
And we have nothing to say.

484
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,230
What would you like to say?

485
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,400
All of the things you want to say
to someone who suddenly went away.

486
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,420
How you miss them.

487
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,800
How the air was sucked out of
your lungs the moment they left.

488
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,590
How you will never, ever...

489
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,480
.. fully inhale again in the same way.

490
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,620
How you miss them.

491
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,380
How you miss them till your teeth ache.

492
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,470
Thank you.

493
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,750
Yes, thank you, River.

494
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,600
I-I was almost moved for a
moment, there, my friend.

495
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,080
Poor River.

496
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,560
(All alone.)

497
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,320
Why don't you tell them about the
day you thought you were Rasputin?

498
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,950
You have made your own hell, River.

499
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,550
You have bowed down to despair.

500
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,190
All I have ever done is
shown you that those who feel

501
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,980
capacity for love also feel hate!

502
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,830
FEEL HATE, RIVER!

503
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,620
UNTIL DEATH IS YOUR ONLY ESCAPE!

504
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,620
No matter. The mind is its own place...

505
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,150
.. and, in itself, can
make a heaven of hell.

506
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,790
I'm your hell.

507
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,040
I will never leave you.

508
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,910
I'm not listening to you any more.

509
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,900
I'M NOT LISTENING!

510
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,980
I'm sorry.

511
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,680
When I was 14, I was riding
buses and buying records.

512
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,030
You weren't to know.

513
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,100
- You were...
- Because I didn't tell you.

514
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Where we're from...

515
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,670
.. where we come from, that...

516
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,920
doesn't make us, River.

517
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,080
It can't be all we are.

518
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,550
I don't know what you want from me.

519
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,940
I've put on another three pounds.

520
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,550
- I know.
- Right!

521
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,000
I know the truth, Frankie.

522
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,400
I, uh...

523
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,470
I passed this bloke I went
to school with yesterday.

524
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,750
He had his kids with him.

525
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,500
One on his shoulder and the
other was in the buggy.

526
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,720
And he asked about Stevie.

527
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,840
Gave his condolences and that.

528
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,830
But all I could think was...

529
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,950
"That's a real man."

530
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
"That's... That's what a real man... is."

531
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,760
Ask me why.

532
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,820
Come on. Ask me why I did it.

533
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,230
Why?

534
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,950
This time...

535
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,110
.. she were going to let
her do it to us again.

536
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,750
"Frankie. She's going to break the family.

537
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,430
"Again."

538
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,320
No, Mummy. No.

539
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,640
So tired of always being
at Michael's beck and call.

540
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,280
I thought..."Stevie."

541
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,230
If I tell Stevie,

542
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,030
Stevie could always make it...

543
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,480
Better.

544
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,700
Only, this time...

545
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,080
Stevie wasn't listening any more.

546
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,920
Why wasn't she listening any more?

547
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,160
"We have to do this, now!" But...

548
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,470
"But what about Mummy?

549
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,950
"We can't do that to her."

550
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,200
Because Stevie left me.

551
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,150
Stevie left me...

552
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,830
with Mummy...

553
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,110
for so many years.

554
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,270
No! You weren't there!

555
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,390
YOU WEREN'T THERE!

556
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,150
It was me alone with her!

557
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,430
Me alone with Mummy! ME! NOT HER!

558
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,150
Year after year.

559
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,000
Do you know what that feels like?!

560
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,780
Francis Eric Stevenson...

561
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,990
.. I arrest you for the murder

562
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,240
of Detective Sergeant
Jacqueline Stevenson.

563
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,670
River, what are you doing here?

564
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,560
The cleaner let me in.

565
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,230
Oh, the kids will be back soon.

566
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,080
You have foxes.

567
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,670
I was going to make some... some tea.

568
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,120
- She's Columbian.
- Who?

569
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,950
- Your cleaner.
- Oh, yes.

570
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,140
- Is she?
- Yeah.

571
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,030
She's new, so...

572
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,880
Tom's on his way home.

573
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,420
They've granted bail.

574
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,590
I'll need to resign.

575
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,830
I know.

576
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,920
I know, you think I'm an idiot,
but he's my husband and...

577
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,270
I have to tell the kids.

578
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,980
Right.

579
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,080
- What will you say?
- The truth.

580
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,720
That their father is a weak, dishonest...

581
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,700
.. faithless shit.

582
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,000
Sounds good.

583
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,230
What are you doing here?

584
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,790
'Even if you were just colleagues,

585
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,270
'there was love, perhaps?

586
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,790
'There should be more
than one word for love.

587
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,510
'I've seen love that kills and
I've seen love that redeems.

588
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,750
'I've seen love that
believes in the guilty,

589
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,600
'and love that saves the bereaved.

590
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,840
'What we will do for love.

591
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
'Die for it, even.'

592
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,940
Which one?

593
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,520
Red.

594
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,360
Nice, blood. Nice.

595
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,670
Don't be nervous, man.

596
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,590
You can do this.

597
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,990
- Table for two?
- Yes.

598
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,430
Hurry up. Come on, hurry up.

599
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,070
You're wearing lipstick.

600
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,390
I've ordered crispy duck, pancakes.

601
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,590
There can't be many points
in seaweed, can there?

602
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,040
No. Practically pointless.

603
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,920
You look tired.

604
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,660
I should take a vacation.

605
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,480
I was thinking of a week in Ibiza.

606
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And then you say...

607
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,390
I took my mother to dinner
with my first pay cheque.

608
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,790
She didn't eat anything.

609
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,510
Wanted to go.

610
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,760
- And she said... - "Mais je
n'aime pas la cuisine Francaise...

611
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,760
".. mon cheri."

612
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,220
You speak French now?

613
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,860
When what she meant to say was...

614
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,540
"I'm so proud of you.

615
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,460
"My beautiful boy.

616
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,840
"You have grown into a fine young man.

617
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,600
"And, one day...

618
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,830
".. you will sit here...

619
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,280
"with the woman you love."

620
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,540
And I did. I have.

621
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,320
I am.

622
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,030
Then say it.

623
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,920
Stevie!

624
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,950
We can skip the next bit.

625
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,630
No.

626
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,350
No, no.

627
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,230
This is when you give me the 10,000...

628
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,520
- and you say...
- Look after Frankie.

629
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,000
And I tried. I tried.

630
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,590
And I failed.

631
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,700
And then you say?

632
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,830
Stevie, I...

633
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Still can't say it.

634
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,030
Screw you, Mr Magoo.

635
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,680
I love you.

636
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,520
I love you more than life.

637
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,000
More than life.

638
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
And then you say...

639
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,840
Sing, you nutter. Sing.

00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,190

Yeah.

670
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,980
You eaten yet?

671
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,870
No.

672
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,590
Thought not.

673
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,350
17.

674
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,070
There are 17 points in seaweed.

675
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,030
And I say...

676
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,560
.. I love you, too.

677
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,550

Here you go.

679
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,710
Want the brown one? Yeah.

680
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,710
Yeah, it's in the brown...
Er, no, it's the pink one, OK?

681
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,800
No, that's nappies.

682
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,220
I brought enough for two.

683
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,190
Hello!
