1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey, everyone. It is New Year's Eve! Yeah!

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,560
And we are counting down to the show. Here we go, everybody.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,000
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, fiv... 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold up! Hold up!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,960
It's Will Ferrell, everybody! CHEERING

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,520
Hold up, please. Erm...

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,640
Thank you, thank you.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,040
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, everyone, there's been a terrible incident,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,480
a gigantic magical flying wine truck has collided with the studio

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,920
- and there are hundreds of bottles of Sauvignon blanc everywhere.
- What?

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,840
- I kid you not! 
- LAUGHTER

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,760
What an idiot.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,800
Come on, people. Five, four, three, two, one...

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,040
Let's start the show!

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,120
CHEERING

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,480
This programme contains some strong language.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
LAUGHTER

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,400
- POOR ENGLISH/IRISH ACCENT:
- Good evening, one, and good evening, all.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Welcome to the show, I'm Graham Norton.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,040
We have a fantastic show for you tonight, some amazing guests,

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,800
including a handsome young man

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,080
who's making quite the name for himself, that's Will Ferrell!

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Wow, that guy... that guy is ripped! Really ripped!

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,360
There was no wine.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,600
That is not your beard and that is not your body.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,760
- Go away.
- This wasn't any...? 
- Wait, wait.
- I saw a wine truck...

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Wait! Will Ferrell, everybody!

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
CHEERING

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
He'll be back. He'll be back later.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
He will. Will Ferrell, oh!

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,680
So, it's New Year's Eve! Everyone have a good Christmas?

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,720
AUDIENCE: Yes!

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,840
Did you?

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,040
LAUGHTER

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,840
Really?

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
You don't look well!

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,320
We've got a great show for you to enjoy tonight,

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
wherever you're celebrating.

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,120
Whether it's on the beach, on the ski slopes,

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,600
or on your own local high street.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,680
That's me.

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
It really is a magical time of the year, isn't it?

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
And, ladies and gentlemen, we are bidding farewell to 2015

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,640
with a great line-up of guests. Not just Will Ferrell,

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
he'll also be joined by his Daddy's Home co-star,

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,120
Mark Wahlberg, everyone.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Yes! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,040
They'll be here later.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,240
And we'll have a performance of one of this year's bestselling hits,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,760
from Years And Years, they're here.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Adorable!

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,680
But first, this man has had a phenomenal year,

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,520
winning the Bafta, Golden Globe, and Oscar

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,360
for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything,

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,120
now he's tipped for further glory playing the first person

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,600
to undergo gender reassignment in The Danish Girl,

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,040
welcome back Eddie Redmayne, everybody!

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
Yay! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,560
This way, this way. Hey!

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,360
- Happy New Year! 
- How are you?
- I am really well.

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Lovely to see you. Have a seat.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,280
And joining Eddie, it's the Oscar-winning actress

64
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,880
who wowed us in The Hunger Games, X-Men, and Silver Linings Playbook,

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,760
now she's Golden Globe nominated again for her role

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,640
in the rags to riches movie, Joy,

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,920
please welcome, for the first-time to the show,

68
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,120
the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence!

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Yay!

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,320
- Always wanted you! 
- You'd only to ask!
- Aw!

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,000
- Well, you're here!
- Thank you. 
- Sit down! Sit down!

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Oh!

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm leaving my lipstick there, cos I think we're going

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,760
- to be here for a while, right? 
- I love that, emergency lipstick.

75
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,600
- I did, yeah, I should hide it from the camera.
- Yeah!

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,480
And, if you guys don't know, this is where babies come from.

77
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,320
LAUGHTER

78
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,920
- Look, showbiz babies. 
- I'm so happy I picked this dress!

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,440
It's a nice, sparkly...

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,480
- I'm just going to get drunk and then I won't care.
- Yeah!

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,320
It's New Year's Eve! CHEERING

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,200
- Don't forget that.
- I don't know. I really hate New Year's Eve.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,920
- I've never had a good New Year's Eve.
- Always a disappointment.

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Always disappointing, everybody's always chasing a good time...

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,880
Jennifer, Jennifer, on message, this is New Year's Eve.

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,800
- Oh, right.
- People are watching this! 
- I'm on The Graham Norton Show.

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,960
You're depressing them now, they're thinking...

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
- Do people think this is how I am spending New Year's Eve?! 
- No, that's my point!

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,840
LAUGHTER

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
- That's so sad!
- I know... 
- I'm working!

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,080
- They're thinking, "No wonder she hates it!"
- Yeah!

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,680
- No, no! So, in real life, you're doing nothing?
- Hmm...

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,560
I don't know. I'm going to, like, plan on doing nothing,

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,320
and then, if something lands in my lap...

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,520
I don't know, I always end up, like, disappointed.

96
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,520
- Drunk, but disappointed. 
- That's my life!

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
SHE LAUGHS

98
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,400
That's the title of my memoir!

99
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Damn, I should've got that title!

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,480
- Eddie, what are you doing? 
- I am... Do you know what?

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,880
My wife and I, we're renting this place in the countryside,

102
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,880
- and we were hoping it was going to...
- I would love to!
- Come!

103
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,040
Unfortunately, I don't think there are any carpets or anything.

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,000
- But we're stubbornly... 
- Why does Jennifer need carpets?

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,880
She doesn't, just bring a sleeping bag,

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
join us around the fire, that's the plan, I think.

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
I think he means that I'll only go if there's a red carpet!

108
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,720
Yeah, there's no red carpet! Sorry! How will you get in?

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,440
Where do I step?

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,280
Just in the car, "How does this happen?"

111
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Well, listen, Jennifer is returning to our screens

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,640
in the latest comedy drama directed by David O Russell.

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,080
It opens tomorrow, it's called Joy.

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
You play Joy, so tell us about Joy.

115
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,400
Joy is the story of Joy Mangano,

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,240
also inspired by other women who inspired David,

117
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,600
and she is a mother of two working at Eastern Airlines,

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,720
she gets this brilliant idea for this mop,

119
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,360
and it's about her journey to sort of make it happen,

120
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,120
and then the story of success afterwards.

121
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,800
I have now had far too much whisky to promote this movie!

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,680
No, but what's great about it, because it is a true story,

123
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,760
- that you think you know where it's going, the plot...
- Yeah.

124
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,280
..and then it's just like, "What just happened?"

125
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,800
- It is a mad story.
- Yeah, thank God that's not what I said!

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,200
I mean, you think you know what's going on and then it's like, "Mrgh!"

127
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
And then, it's like, "Yeah!"

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,680
That's how I feel like talking about it now,

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,840
cos you're totally right. Yes. There are a lot of ups and downs,

130
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,120
and some beautiful and scary, ugly sides of success.

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,080
- Yeah!
- What's it like working with Robert De Niro?
- Oh, it's so fun.

132
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,000
- Is it kind of fun working with pals? 
- Have you ever had repeated...?

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,680
- No, never, no-one wants me back! 
- Yeah, once bitten!
- Ah...

134
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,200
All right, let's watch a clip, this is a clip from Joy.

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400
- You watch it, I'm going to change. 
- LAUGHTER

136
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
- OK, sorry, play the clip. 
- You look lovely. You look great.

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
This is you and Bradley Cooper,

138
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,160
and you fighting for your place on QVC.

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,320
You said to me that David Selznick, the son of immigrants,

140
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,760
married Jennifer Jones, an all-American girl from Oklahoma,

141
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,280
because, in America, all races and classes

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,840
can meet and make whatever opportunities they can.

143
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,800
And that is what you feel

144
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,720
when you reach into people's homes with what you sell.

145
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
You said that.

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,880
CHEERING

147
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
"Yay, me! I'm amazing!"

148
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,000
I should have cymbals!

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
- "I'm fantastic!"
- God, I'm useless!

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
- You're so good, and so good in this.
- Thank you.

151
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,680
And, of course, the third time you've worked with David O Russell.

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
- Yeah.
- And it sounds like, when he's directing you,

153
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
he doesn't really have a filter.

154
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,600
Did he ever have a filter?

155
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,480
- He certainly doesn't have a filter any more.
- Erm, no.

156
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,600
He doesn't have a filter with anything, but he's just pure cinema,

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,240
he's just pure... I think it's really lovely.

158
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,880
Cos I grew up doing sports.

159
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,200
So whenever directors try to get emotional,

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,480
"I think the character would be, at this point..."

161
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm like, "What does that mean?"

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Like, David's just like, "That sucks!"

163
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
You know, that makes sense to me.

164
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,680
"OK, got it. I'll do it better this time."

165
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,160
- He doesn't really say that to you, does he?
- Of course!

166
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,600
He was breathing behind me

167
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
when we were doing the diner scene on Silver Linings,

168
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,880
he's behind the booth, laying there,

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,720
and he has a monitor, and he goes like, "Grrr!"

170
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,880
And I can hear his breathing, and I'm like, "He doesn't like this!"

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
And then he'll go, "Oh, it's bullshit, it's just bullshit."

172
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,640
And I would just be like, "What do you want?"

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,000
And he'd be like, "Just do it without bullshit."

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,200
And then, eventually, I learned that meant lower my voice a little bit.

175
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,800
And so now, we just always work together,

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,680
- cos he knows bullshit equals lower voice.
- Yeah.
- Shorthand.

177
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Eddie's one of those... You like the chatting about it, don't you?

178
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,760
I need to be mollycoddled and told I'm great

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,600
- in order for me to do anything! 
- No, you do not!
- I promise I do.

180
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
- I like...
- I'll never forget that head smack,

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,640
from - what's it called? - Theory Of Everything.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,440
No, but this, when we did this interview together, like,

183
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,680
Jen, who's done more stunts and sort of action, brilliant set pieces,

184
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
we were trying to talk about Theory Of Everything,

185
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
and she kept going back to the head smack...

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
- I'm sorry.
- ..when I hit my head. She was like, "Tell me how you did it!"

187
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,000
I know, you literally won an Academy Award for this performance,

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,920
and I haven't said one thing to you about anything artistic

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,160
about the movie. I'm like, "How did you do that head smack, bro?"

190
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,280
In the interview, trying to create some really complicated way

191
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,680
in which I did it, whereas actually they just sort of

192
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,200
put a foam bit on the floor

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
and they just tied my hands and made me do that...

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,360
Oh! Even whacking your head on foam without holding your...

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,920
- That's scary!
- So brave!

196
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,680
LAUGHTER

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,960
- Cheers!
- Well done, you. Well done, you.

198
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,840
Now, I don't want to jinx anything, but Eddie Redmayne

199
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
was here last New Year's Eve.

200
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,040
As he left the building, I said, "Good luck with the Oscars."

201
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,960
Only won an Oscar! He won an Oscar, ladies and gentlemen!

202
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

203
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,400
- Thanks for that, Graham. 
- Yeah!
- Very generous.

204
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,120
I was, right before he ran out, when you were introducing him,

205
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,400
I realised, we had been like talking and catching up,

206
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
and then you're like, "..Academy Award winner..."

207
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,960
I was like, "Oh, my God, I totally forgot! Congratulations!"

208
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Never talked to you after that.

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,240
- And again... 
- Not on purpose!
- Not on purpose!

210
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,320
And again, it's weird, cos you don't want to talk about these things,

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,040
but, you'd a bad one, was it the night you won your Oscar?

212
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,760
The night I won...

213
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
- I don't want to talk about that night, I had a whole meltdown.
- OK!

214
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,160
That sounds riveting, I want to talk about that!

215
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,200
It was a series of things, it was like a birth control confusion,

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
so I was like hormonal, I fell on my face,

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,400
I forgot to thank the director,

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,920
so I was just like, "What does it all mean? Nothing!"

219
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,120
I just came home crying...

220
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
And then, my friend, like, ordered the wrong pizza,

221
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
it wasn't thin crust, it was thick crust, I was just like...

222
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,080
SHE SOBS

223
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,400
I imagine very different scenes in the Redmayne household.

224
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,760
- Slightly different.
- Oh, really?

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,680
Well, basically, I have a plethora of brothers,

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,360
and their sort of favourite thing is to sort of come...

227
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,960
I did this film a couple of years ago called Savage Grace,

228
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,520
with Julianne Moore.

229
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,080
- Keep going, quickly. 
- What's disastrous?

230
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,960
- What?
- No, no, you left them at "come".
- Come!

231
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,720
- LAUGHTER 
- Oh, God!
- What did he say? What?

232
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
It's going to get worse, so I did this film a couple of years ago,

233
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,880
called Savage Grace, and it was one of my early,

234
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,200
one of the first jobs, I was so proud of it,

235
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
it was with Julianne Moore, it involved incest,

236
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
I played her son, and she sleeps with him,

237
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,360
to sort of try and change his sexuality, anyway...

238
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,920
- LAUGHTER 
- ..I was so pleased

239
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
to have got a job, I was so proud of it,

240
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,600
and they came to the London Film Festival premiere,

241
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,840
and it was only as I was sitting down, surrounded by my family,

242
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,200
with all my brothers, sitting next to my Dad,

243
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,800
basically looking like this, as I was about to do a love scene

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
with my mother in the film, just to see what his reaction would be.

245
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,840
Basically, that's always their thing,

246
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
see who can get closest to Dad,

247
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,400
- in order to watch what his perilous reaction is going to be.
- Oh, yeah!

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,360
- Ooh!
- I had to kick my brother out from award season for a little bit,

249
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,240
cos he tried to arm wrestle Matthew McConaughey.

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,480
He was, like, not into it, it was Winter's Bone,

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,280
nobody knew who I was, so he was...

252
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,440
- So there was that. 
- He took down McConaughey?

253
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,760
And my mum is your... How is your mum during premieres?

254
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,800
- She's pretty good, actually. 
- She's normal?

255
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
But only because I always say to her...

256
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,080
I remember we had this amazing experience at the Tony Awards,

257
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,720
when she came as my date, and I said...

258
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,520
- That's cute.
- .."Mum, what happens is they come up on cameras,

259
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,760
"and they look at your face, so when I don't win, you have got to look...

260
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,600
- "You know, you can't get, 'Grr!' you know, really angry."
- Yeah!

261
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
And my mum... I love my mum, she is quite competitive.

262
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Anyway, this moment happened, and I was nominated for a prize,

263
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,200
and them, I was lucky enough to win, and I was so elated, but my mum,

264
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,360
I'd given such a grilling to, she's just sort of sat there.

265
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,320
- LAUGHTER 
- "I'm not allowed to react!"

266
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
- I'm like, "I've won!" 
- That's so funny.

267
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
The whole family, the whole family I'm sure,

268
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,120
will be very proud of your new film, The Danish Girl.

269
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
It also opens tomorrow,

270
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,960
and it's had a lot of press.

271
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,640
And it is an extraordinary story,

272
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,840
and more extraordinary, because it is mostly true, all true, or...?

273
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,080
Yes, it is based on Lili and Gerda's life,

274
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,160
this couple who lived in 1920s, in Copenhagen,

275
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,240
and, um, Lili was one of the first people to transition,

276
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,280
to undergo gender confirmation surgery in the 1930s.

277
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,880
And it's really about this... It's a really passionate love story

278
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
about these two, kind of, extraordinary people.

279
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,120
And this film, they've been trying to get it made for years...

280
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,040
- It's been a long road, Graham! 
- Yeah! And what's odd is that,

281
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,040
now that it finally comes blinking into the light...

282
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,160
- Mm-hm.
- ..it's hit this moment when these issues

283
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
- are more high profile than ever before.
- Yeah.

284
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,720
- But that is just coincidence?
- It is. It's been 15 years in the making.

285
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,600
And I was making Les Miserables about four, five years ago,

286
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
and Tom Hooper, the director, he gave me the script,

287
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,520
and he didn't say anything about it.

288
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,720
He gave me this surreptitious brown envelope and he said,

289
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,160
"Have a read of this." and I was completely sucker punched by it.

290
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,880
I found such a beautiful story.

291
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
And I said, "Where can I sign up? He was like, "No, no.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
"This film's probably not going to happen for a while."

293
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,400
And, as you say, it's come out at this time,

294
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,880
and there's such a shift in the past year, of trans issues

295
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,000
coming to the mainstream, but kind of what was staggering for me

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
was their story happened almost 100 years ago,

297
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,000
and it's sort of astounding how little progress there's been,

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,840
only in the past couple of years there really has been some change.

299
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,640
And one of those weird things for you, as an actor, that, suddenly,

300
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,000
you have to become a kind of spokesperson,

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,800
- or you're kind of representing, in a way.
- Well, it's...

302
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, it's incredibly, um...

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,680
For me, it's wonderful, because the story is so beautiful,

304
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
and the people I met, preparing to play the part,

305
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,840
people from the trans community, who were incredibly generous,

306
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,080
and so, the whole thing has been a privilege, really,

307
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,000
and getting to - not in any way talk for the community - because...

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,960
- but really to try and be an ally. Learn to be an ally.
- Yeah!

309
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,240
All right, we've got a clip from The Danish Girl.

310
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,800
This is you and your wife, who we must also mention,

311
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,120
- cos she's fabulous! 
- She's wonderful.
- Alicia Vikander.

312
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
And this is the morning after Lili's first public appearance.

313
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Exactly what happened between you

314
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,920
- and Sandahl last night? 
- Nothing. It was nothing.

315
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,400
- Did he know it was you? 
- It wasn't as simple as that.

316
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,920
I watched him kiss you, Einar, so could you please make an effort?

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,680
He may have known who I was, but I wasn't always m-me.

318
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,240
There was a moment when I was just Lili

319
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
and I think that he could see that.

320
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,800
- Do you see?
- But Lili doesn't exist.

321
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,640
- We made her up.
- I know.
- We were playing a game.
- I know we were.

322
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,200
But then...

323
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,920
..something changed.

324
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,640
CHEERING

325
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
Wow.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,880
As I've already said, that comes out tomorrow as well.

327
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,400
Now, the thing is,

328
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,240
because it's so unusual to have two such young Oscar winners...

329
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,160
- This normally happens... 
- That's why we're friends!
- Yeah!

330
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,280
You're part of an elite club. But the other thing you share

331
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,160
is quite short-lived careers in modelling.

332
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,240
- I thought you said just "shortest careers"!
- I know!

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
- Wow!
- I was like... "Oooh! Oh."

334
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,160
- Happy New Year(!)
- Yeah! 
- So, because you...

335
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
What was your big break?

336
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,200
- Was it Vogue? Esquire? 
- Where are we going with this?

337
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,440
- I think all of the above! 
- Talk about modelling. Talk about it!

338
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
- Or was it, in fact...? 
- Want me to talk about my modelling?

339
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,040
- I think HE'S about to talk about my modelling!
- Oh, my God!

340
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,400
- Do you have pictures? 
- Yes, because, he did...

341
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,720
Look at these. Like, it's hard to make a jumper sexy.

342
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
- True that. 
- LAUGHTER

343
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,440
But I think he has managed it.

344
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

345
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,760
Has wool... Has wool ever looked hotter?

346
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,800
- I mean, seriously...
- Here's the thing, your sweater his eyeballs.

347
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,920
LAUGHTER

348
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,520
God, that was a high point...

349
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,200
- Oh, my God!
- ..but I think you can actually still buy that,

350
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,440
and the point of that is you can learn to knit it yourself.

351
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,600
- Oh!
- So you guys can take one of those home and knit it yourself.

352
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
So I can buy the sweater,

353
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
- and then I have to do it myself as well?
- Yeah!

354
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,920
Actually, there's a classic thing in here.

355
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,240
So you know when you want something for Christmas

356
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,320
and say to your mum or granny, "I'd really like a trendy sweat top,

357
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
"I'd like a really nice, trendy, zippy-up top"?

358
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
And then they knit it for you.

359
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
LAUGHTER

360
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,720
- "NO!"
- Yeah, that's the Christmas nightmare!
- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,920
But you still do some modelling, don't you?

362
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,480
- Sporadically and very unsuccessfully.
- Stop it!

363
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,520
- You do big brands! 
- I don't know any of this!

364
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,640
I did a campaign for Burberry, which was very amazing.

365
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,360
I did it a few years ago and Mario Testino shot it.

366
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,200
- Oh!
- And I remember... It was when I was just starting out

367
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,440
and, in this photograph, there was sort of a model,

368
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,240
and me, an actor, wannabe actor, and a musician.

369
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,280
And Mario Testino, who I'd never worked with,

370
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,800
who is one of the most extraordinary, brilliant people,

371
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,880
but, in that moment, he was almost like a parody of himself.

372
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,240
So, we had to run and jump for the photograph.

373
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,960
And he goes, he's literally got the camera there, and he goes...

374
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,760
- MOCK ITALIAN ACCENT: 
- "OK, so, darling,

375
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,960
"you supermodel, you rock star, Eddie, you movie star,

376
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
"I'm Mario Testino, and one, two, three...go!"

377
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,400
LAUGHTER

378
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,040
And I leapt into the air... I leapt into the air

379
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,640
and these two, sort of, pros, and me, at the end, going...

380
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
But he gets the photos, because they're so natural ones

381
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,920
of sort of shock and minor despair and wonder,

382
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,280
- I think, at the same time. 
- Cos you...

383
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
- You don't have my pictures... 
- I don't!
- ..and I'll tell you why.

384
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes, tell us why, because really,

385
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,680
- an amazing job to get. 
- I was an Abercrombie model.
- Get in.

386
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,800
- Abercrombie and Fitch, ladies and gentlemen!
- Don't make your hoots!

387
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,120
- Wait till the end of the story! 
- Pre-emptive hoots!

388
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,960
So my pictures never came out, I did like the whole campaign,

389
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,480
and the pictures never came out, and I didn't know why,

390
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
and my agent wrote and asked why,

391
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,760
and they literally only responded with the photos.

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
LAUGHTER

393
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,280
Because they, like, their whole idea was, like, "We want real people."

394
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
So they, like, got...

395
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know, we were on a beach, and they threw us a football

396
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,680
and they were like, "Play football!"

397
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,200
And all the other models were playing football,

398
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,960
like, in the pretty way. You know, like... Not me!

399
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,560
I was... All of the photos, I've got a red face, covered in sweat,

400
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,040
my nostrils are flared, I'm like, "Aargh!"...

401
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,520
..in the back of a picture.

402
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,960
At one point, a girl yelled, "Get her away from me!"

403
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

404
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
So...

405
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm desperate to see those photos.

406
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,480
You won't see them in a store, that's for sure.

407
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,520
Good luck. Good luck to both of you and really I wish you all the best

408
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
with both these movies and with 2016.

409
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,560
Ladies and gentlemen, Eddie Redmayne and Jennifer Lawrence.

410
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,040
CHEERING

411
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,320
Yay.

412
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
CHEERING DROWNS OUT SPEECH

413
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,320
And so... And so to my next Hogmanay guest.

414
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
Will Ferrell has made us laughed with films like Elf, Old School,

415
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Talladega Nights and his star turn as legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy,

416
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,160
while Mark Wahlberg is a multi-talented actor/producer

417
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,120
who has given us drama in The Fighter,

418
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,080
action in The Departed and comedy in Ted and The Other Guys.

419
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,160
Now they're back together in the hilarious new movie, Daddy's Home.

420
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
Here's Will as the stepfather

421
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,120
trying to impress the kids in front of real dad Mark.

422
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,080
One lucky fan is going to get

423
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,480
a chance to shoot from half-court to win a family vacation

424
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,080
- to Disney World! 
- CHEERING

425
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,080
That's right, and our lucky fan is sitting in section 113,

426
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,280
row six, seat one.

427
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
Where is he? Let's see it! Where is he?

428
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,320
It's me. It's me. I win. I win.

429
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,400
I'm going to Disneyland. I'm going to make it right.

430
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
Yay!

431
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,440
All right, sir, what's your name?

432
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,680
First off, I love my kids.

433
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,240
- He loves his kids! Let's give it up! 
- CHEERING

434
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,840
This one is for Dylan and Megan and Sarah and Dylan.

435
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,240
Nothing but net.

436
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
All right, he's going for it, nothing but net.

437
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,960
SHE SCREAMS, CROWD GROANS

438
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,040
Please welcome Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg.

439
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,840
CHEERING

440
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Nice to see you. Hello.

441
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,200
Sit down. Sit down. Hey!

442
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,040
- Oh, naughty, yes.
- Naughty.

443
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,000
- Oh! Yes! Yes!
- Yes!
- I know!
- Yes!

444
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,640
CHEERING

445
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,240
It's a little later. It's a little later,

446
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,360
- so we thought we might roll out some real drinks...
- Great.
- ..because,

447
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,600
Will Ferrell, you have a bar in New York dedicated to you.

448
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
- Apparently, I do, yes. 
- Have you been?
- I haven't been.

449
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,600
- That seems almost rude.
- A little. 
- They don't want him to come.

450
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,040
It's a Will Ferrell-themed bar, but they don't want Will Ferrell.

451
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,800
- It's called Stay Classy, right? 
- Yes. Stay Classy New York.

452
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,480
- Is that what it's called? 
- Stay Classy New York. Yeah, it is.

453
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,680
- We've got a selection of cocktails. 
- I've been.
- You've been?
- Yes.

454
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
- Have you really been? 
- I was invited, yeah.

455
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,040
- LAUGHTER 
- I haven't been invited yet.

456
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,240
I can offer you... There's a cocktail called Great Odin's Raven.

457
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,200
- There's Smelly Pirate Hooker. 
- Mm-hm.
- There's a Whale's Vagina.

458
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,520
Or, my favourite, I Piss Excellence.

459
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,800
- Er, fancy any of those?
- Well, I've got to go for a Whale's Vagina.

460
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,240
- A Whale's Vagina is... That's the Whale's Vagina. OK.
- OK.

461
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,520
- That's a Smelly Pirate Hooker, that one.
- Yeah, give me the Pirate.

462
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,440
OK, have a Pirate Hooker. And I'll have Piss Excellence.

463
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,040
How is your Whale's Vagina?

464
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,880
From what I remember, that's exactly what...

465
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
LAUGHTER

466
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,400
..it should taste like, yeah!

467
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,800
- Cheers.
- Oh, it's very potent. Yeah.

468
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,560
- And Happy New Year's. 
- Happy New Year!

469
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,600
Happy New Year, everyone. Happy New Year.

470
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
So now, of course, Christmas has gone.

471
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,320
How was Christmas, Mark Wahlberg?

472
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,480
- Christmas was wonderful.
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.
- What was your best present?

473
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,520
- I didn't get anything.
- No, Mark!

474
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,480
I didn't get anything. And I didn't give the kids anything.

475
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,360
LAUGHTER

476
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
I figured why bother?

477
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
- Yeah, tough love.
- Exactly.

478
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,200
Didn't we just do this last year? I mean, come on.

479
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,520
- They're not going to remember anyway.
- Do something original.
- Yeah.

480
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,000
- Christmas for you must be amazing, cos you're Elf.
- I, er...

481
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes, I'm Elf.

482
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,520
But that's too scary for my children. They don't...

483
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,560
It's not too scary for mine. How do I get Elf to show up to my house?

484
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,280
- So I can be cool.
- 50,000 euros.

485
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,040
That's not a problem. Do you have the tights on under the suit?

486
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,920
I have the tights on right now, yes.

487
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,480
I've been wearing them since Christmas Day.

488
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,520
- It's Christmas...
- Yeah, yeah.

489
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,240
As I say, the two of you bring us a festive treat in Daddy's Home,

490
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,040
and it's in cinemas everywhere now.

491
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,880
And it's a very kind of modern family comedy in that

492
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,600
it's about a stepfather coming face-to-face with the biological dad.

493
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,240
Yeah, it's kind of, I mean, the story of kind of the blended family

494
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,800
that we're coming across more and more and, yeah,

495
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm the stepfather to your kids

496
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,280
and I pride myself on being the world's greatest dad.

497
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,120
I cry a little too much, I'm very emotionally available...

498
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
..which is sickening.

499
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,600
- And, er, then, Dusty comes into the picture.
- Who is...
- A real man's man.

500
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,240
- Yes.
- Yeah!
- And as I say, it's really, really funny.

501
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,800
Lots of big laugh out loud moments,

502
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,400
- like the moment in the clip we just saw.
- Right.
- And...

503
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,440
Which people thought was real. When we were filming it.

504
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,320
We shot it in a national basketball game

505
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,480
and we only had six minutes, so they basically said, "At half-time,

506
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,400
"stay in your seats, because you can be in a scene of a movie,"

507
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,360
but they didn't tell them what we were doing

508
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,800
and then, all of a sudden, Will stumbles onto the court

509
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
pretending to be drunk and hits the cheerleader.

510
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,160
I had at least five or six Whale's Vaginas going in.

511
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,640
LAUGHTER

512
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,880
And it just went viral. People were going crazy all over the internet.

513
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,240
People thought I had wandered into a live NBA basketball game

514
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,520
and had taken the liberty to peg a cheerleader in the head,

515
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,080
and that I should be severely reprimanded,

516
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,920
which I couldn't argue with, but...

517
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,360
But also, it's just as well you are good at sports,

518
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,120
because, you know, it'd have taken me

519
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,640
forever to try and hit that cheerleader in the face.

520
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,920
He hit that poor girl about five times in a row.

521
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,160
I said, "I think we got it on the first take," he was like,

522
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
"Oh, no, no, no. I need another"

523
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,760
"I don't think she wants to do it again."

524
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,440
- "I just need one more."
- She did. She told me she did, OK? Relax.

525
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,920
Listen, you're both dads yourself and, Mark,

526
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
we've talked about your parenting style.

527
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,640
- You're firm, but fair in the Wahlberg household.
- Yes.

528
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,320
- But you are very involved. You're very hands-on.
- Mm-hm.

529
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,080
- You go to all their sporting games, if you can.
- Oh, absolutely.

530
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,480
Yeah. But they're not liking me at the games any more.

531
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,440
I get a little too crazy. I get a little too passionate.

532
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,280
- I know, because they've taken pictures of you.
- Oh, God!

533
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,640
There's another picture. You're really going for it in this next one.

534
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
Look at that. Rargh! You do kind of think,

535
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,040
- you must know...
- Is that you coaching?
- I'm on the sidelines.

536
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,840
- Oh, you're on the sidelines. 
- I'm just with other parents.
- OK.

537
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,680
My wife, always... She'll take...

538
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,000
Cos I bring these chairs, she takes a chair and sits down the other end.

539
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,040
Acts like she doesn't know me.

540
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,560
But EVERYONE knows you. Don't you think you should just tone it down?

541
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,760
- I can't help it.
- I've been there.

542
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,240
He just played in the championship game and I couldn't even eat.

543
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,080
I mean, my stomach was in butterflies. He's nine.

544
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,320
My stomach was in butterflies and, oh, God, it was crazy.

545
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,600
I lost my voice for about a week, screaming, yelling.

546
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,440
- Did they win?
- No.
- Ooh!

547
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
So I had to beat him.

548
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,960
LAUGHTER

549
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,000
I had money on that freaking game.

550
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,120
So did I.

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,160
A little red button thing like, "Is Mark joking?"

552
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,520
- Will, you coach.
- I coach. I've experienced the same thing.

553
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,720
- You forget... 
- He'd be the worst coach!
- Why?

554
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,280
Because they could be down 20,

555
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,120
"Don't worry, guys, you're doing really good. You know what?

556
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,560
"There are a lot of positive things happening. Why are you crying?

557
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,440
- "It's OK."
- "You learn more from defeat than winning."

558
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,960
LAUGHTER

559
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,920
Have you ever said that out loud, Will?

560
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,080
- Sadly, that's exactly my strategy.
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

561
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,840
But I did have a moment where I was screaming at my oldest son,

562
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,160
who was ten years old at the time, and I was like,

563
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,640
"Magnus! MAGNUS! MAGNUS!"

564
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,720
And he stops in the middle of the game and he's like, "What?"

565
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,480
And I realised I had lost my mind and I just said, "Never mind.

566
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,800
"Just try to get closer to the ball..."

567
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,080
But it's hard. It's hard to not get wrapped up in the excitement.

568
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,920
It must be hard, because everyone must recognise you at a game.

569
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,760
Usually. Usually.

570
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,960
I was growing my moustache out for Anchorman 2 and coaching

571
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,400
on the sideline and the opposing coach was like, "You look familiar."

572
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,440
And I go, "Yeah."

573
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,680
"Are you that actor?" I'm like, "I think so."

574
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,600
He said, "Is that moustache real?"

575
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,440
I said, "Yes, why would I be wearing a fake moustache...

576
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,080
"..at a kids' soccer game?"

577
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,600
- It's happened.
- "Honey, hold on, I've got to put my fake moustache on

578
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,880
"so that I'm unrecognisable."

579
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,600
And this is your second movie together, so you obviously get on.

580
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,720
- Yeah. Swimmingly. 
- Good. Happy to hear it.

581
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,600
But you have offended co-stars, Will Ferrell. Was it Harrison Ford?

582
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,760
- What happened with him? 
- On, yeah, this was not good.

583
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
You worked with Harrison Ford?

584
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,600
He shot on the first day of Anchorman 2

585
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,760
and we were all very nervous to work with him. That's him, by the way.

586
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,800
- Audiovisual aid.
- Yeah.
- That's him.

587
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,480
And he came into the trailer and, you know, it's Harrison Ford, right?

588
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,600
And I'm very diligent, as is Mark, when we're filming.

589
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,880
Go to bed early, don't usually go out to dinner, and he...

590
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,880
As he's getting his make-up off, he's like, "Dinner?"

591
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,960
And I'm like, "No, I'm good, I have something in my trailer."

592
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,160
And then he leaves

593
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,440
and I realise I just turned down Harrison Ford for dinner.

594
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,920
Um...

595
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,320
That's the end of the story.

596
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,800
LAUGHTER

597
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,680
It's kind of worse than that, isn't it?

598
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,320
- It's not like you were saying you had other plans.
- Not at all.

599
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,480
- You just said, "I'm going to eat something..."
- I'm going to eat...

600
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,920
a bad Styrofoam case full of food provided to me by catering.

601
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm not going to choose to have dinner with you,

602
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,480
Harrison Ford, where you can regale me in stories.

603
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,720
I'm choosing my boiled chicken.

604
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,280
- Yeah.
- Have you seen him again?

605
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,400
I haven't. I've tried to find him.

606
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,920
- I have.
- Have you had dinner with him?
- Yes.
- What has he said?

607
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,160
He told me to tell you to go fuck yourself.

608
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
LAUGHTER

609
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,480
I highly doubt that.

610
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,800
And that you are a pompous, arrogant piece of shit.

611
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,040
I love that Mark Wahlberg is saying this,

612
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,160
and I look down and my next question is, "Mark Wahlberg,

613
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,840
"you had an extraordinary gig a few months ago."

614
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
- Oh, with the Pope?
- Yeah!

615
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
LAUGHTER

616
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,280
You hosted the Pope.

617
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,360
- Yes, I did. 
- Did the Pope recognise you?
- Er, no.

618
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,560
He hasn't watched television since the mid-80s.

619
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,440
Except he does love The Graham Norton Show

620
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,120
and he's going to be appalled at your language.

621
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,720
I already apologised for my language in the movies that I've done.

622
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,160
I didn't know if he was a movie fan or not, and I was hugging this

623
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,960
young boy who has an amazing voice, I mean, really a gift from God,

624
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,600
and, all of a sudden, he comes out and goes,

625
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,840
"I really loved you in Ted." This kid's, like, 10-11 years old.

626
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,360
I said, "That's inappropriate for you to watch that."

627
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,440
And then I had to apologise and explain myself.

628
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,480
And did you hang out in any sense?

629
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,400
Er, no, we had a brief encounter, I was able to say hello

630
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,560
and we exchanged some pleasantries and that was pretty much it.

631
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,680
I've never... I mean, I've met presidents. I've never seen

632
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,240
so many people from all walks of life.

633
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Two million people were at this event to come to see,

634
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,960
- just to get a glimpse of this man. 
- Wow.
- And he was on the move.

635
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,000
Originally, he was going to leave

636
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,520
and they started basically cutting bits of the show as we were going.

637
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm hosting the show, so they're telling me,

638
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,440
"Well, this is going and that's going." But then, er...

639
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,600
Er, what is his name, that wonderful singer?

640
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,280
- Um...
- Tony Bennett? 
- No.
- Josh Groban?

641
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
- No.
- Placido Domingo.

642
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,800
Harry from One Direction.

643
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
- You're making it harder to remember.
- OK.

644
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,360
- Sorry.
- What kind of music?

645
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,200
Opera. He's a wonderful gentleman. He has a problem with his eyes.

646
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,080
- WOMAN:
- Andrea Bocelli. 
- Andrea Bocelli.
- Bocelli.
- Yes.

647
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,480
A problem with his eyes! LAUGHTER

648
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,440
I think he's blind, Mark.

649
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960

and then Bocelli kept going and singing more and more songs!

655
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,760

I was going to ask you what was...

745
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
I was going to ask you what were your highlights of 2015,

746
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,640
but this is probably it.

747
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
Still got his hand on my back, by the way.

748
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,400
- Just to let you all know.

But it has been an amazing year, cos this time last year people didn't...

750
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,440
- Well, I didn't know who Years & Years were.
- Cheers.

751
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,160
- You don't know who we are, though.
- Oh... No.

752
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
- LAUGHTER 
- That's OK.

753
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,840
- I was singing that song on the way over!
- I do now.
- Yeah.
- I'm all in.

754
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,400
LAUGHTER

755
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,360
- So, apart from this, apart from this, what are you doing tonight?
- Um...

756
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,320
Oh, yeah, cos it's New Year.

757
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,440
- A Whale's vagina.
- Whale's vaginas. 
- What does it taste like?

758
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,400
- Whale's vagina. - He wouldn't know.

759
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,960
LAUGHTER GRAHAM: And you would?

760
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,400
APPLAUSE

761
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,880
Oh, right, that's a "gay thing".

762
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,960
"Yeah, why would he know what a whale's vagina tastes like?"

763
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,080
"Not like me! Herman Melville over here."

764
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,120
OK, listen, midnight is fast approaching,

765
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,440
so let's have a final visit of the year to our Big Red Chair.

766
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,600
- So who's here? Oh, hello.
- Hello.

767
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,200
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year. 
- What's your name?

- Yes, I am.
- Home of Hogmanay.

769
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,960
- And what do you do?
- I'm an engagement manager for a student union.

770
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
She's not dressed right for the red chair.

771
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
What do you want her to wear?

772
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,280
Looks like that skirt's going to go flying over her head.

773
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,640
Well, we may find out in a minute, Mark.

774
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
Waiting patiently.

775
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
You keep your eyes on the prize.

776
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,120
LAUGHTER

777
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,640
Everywhere. Everywhere.

778
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,120
OK, do you have a New Year's resolution?

779
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,440
- Yes. It's to not be so vain.
- Not be so vain.
- Yes. Hmm!
- OK, off you go.

780
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,120
OK, so, a couple of years ago when I was at university,

781
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,400
my friend Catherine and I were cycling to netball practice, so...

782
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,520
LAUGHTER

783
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,360
There she goes.

784
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,520
You saw nothing. You saw nothing.

785
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,200
We really didn't.

786
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,960
We didn't! We didn't! OK, who's up next?

787
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,480
- Hello!
- Hello.

788
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,960
- What's your name? 
- I'm James.
- James. All right.

789
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,120
- And where are you from, James? 
- I'm from London.
- OK, lovely.

790
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,040
And what's your New Year's resolution?

791
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,600
So, my New Year's resolution next year is going to be

792
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,760
never to get in a helicopter with Ed Miliband.

793
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Good resolution!

794
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
We could probably all make that resolution, sure.

795
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
And probably keep it.

796
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,600
Ed Miliband!

797
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,640
LAUGHTER

798
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
If Ed Miliband turns on the TV now, he'll be so amazed.

799
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,520
"They remember me!"

800
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,600
His New Year's resolution will be not to get in one with me.

801
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,520
Oh, OK, so what happened? Sorry, yes.

802
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,800
So I used to be an Army officer and, when I was a captain, I used

803
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,440
to be the aide to the commander of British forces in Afghanistan.

804
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh, yeah, OK.

805
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,680
Ed came out to visit, I was managing his visit,

806
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,000
and I'd called in a helicopter to take us to the next serial,

807
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,520
but then, I realised that, the day before, I'd had Afghan food

808
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,240
and I had a bit of a gurgle in my stomach,

809
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,280
and I ran towards the portaloos that were the one side,

810
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,640
just the other side of the helicopter landing site

811
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,960
but I didn't make it, and I ended up being covered in

812
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,560
what you can imagine you'd get from eating too much Afghan dairy.

813
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,680
Anyway, I heard the helicopter come in to land...

814
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,040
So, just one second. He shat himself. He shat himself.

815
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,200
- We're clear. 
- Where's Ed Miliband in this story?

816
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,000
- I heard the helicopter coming in to land.
- Ed Miliband's there.

817
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,920
You missed that bit. Ed Miliband was visiting, he's visiting him,

818
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,200
he's now shat himself and a helicopter's landing.

819
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,200
- He has or Ed Miliband? 
- He shat himself.

820
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,480
Ed Miliband, dry as a bone, good as gold.

821
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,400
- For now.
- I'm with it.
- Yeah.

822
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,840
So Ed's at the H&S with all the party, the press,

823
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,400
everything like that. I have to run, covered in my own shit,

824
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,320
all the way to the helicopter, run onto the helicopter

825
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,040
and I get on and I go right to the back.

826
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,200
But who comes and sits next to me but Ed?

827
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,040
And, as you know, if anyone has shit themselves,

828
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,680
once you've started, once that's gone, you can't stop it again.

829
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,600
LAUGHTER

830
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,440
So he's sat there next to me, he knows,

831
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,400
and it comes flowing out again as the helicopter lifts off.

832
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,600
In the grooves of the Chinook, it's going up and down.

833
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,960
There's only one person that knows it's me.

834
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,600
There's the girl that's the door gunner, the RAF door gunner,

835
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,120
she's just got her eyes burning into me,

836
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,800
just knowing exactly what's happened.

837
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,640
The helicopter has to be downed for cleaning for two hours,

838
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,840
taking it off-line. And the best bit is that,

839
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,040
when Ed was flying back from Kabul to London,

840
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,240
the plane that he was flying on had to get diverted to Muscat because

841
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,680
he came down with the same sickness and he was stuck there for 24 hours.

842
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh!

843
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,600
That is a very good story. You've got a question? Stay there.

844
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,160
You were going to walk, but we need a quick question.

845
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,440
What's the name of the restaurant and are they open on New Year's Day?

846
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,880
- Great goat!
- You can walk.
- Thanks.

847
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,200
CHEERING

848
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,520
That was compelling.

849
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,240
That was compelling. Well done, everyone in the Big Red Chair.

850
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,640
And if you would like to join us on the show,

851
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,680
