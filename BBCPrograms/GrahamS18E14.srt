1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, everyone, it's the first show of 2016!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
And, as my New Year's resolution,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,960
I'm going to be taking part in Dry January.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,400
Yeah. What?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,840
It's dry white wine.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,720
Let's start the show.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,720
APPLAUSE

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,360
This programme contains some strong language

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,440
Oh, oh, oh! CHEERING

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,120
Hello, good evening, everybody.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
Welcome, one. Welcome, all.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,160
This is it, everyone. This is it.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,120
It's 2016, it is 2016. Everyone have a good break?

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,680
- AUDIENCE, ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
- Yes! 
- Some of you still on it.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
We've got a great first show of the year for you.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,080
Some great guests, including one

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,160
of the stars of the original Cold Feet,

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,200
which is coming back later this year. Did you know this?

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
Now, I loved Cold Feet and, apparently,

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,480
even the Queen, huge fan of Cold Feet.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,200
Of course, you'll remember my guest in that infamous rose scene.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Hmm.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,800
I wonder what happened to that rose.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,920
Oh, Your Majesty! Let's get some guests on.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,160
Later, we have music from James Bay.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
But, first, the owner of that pert bottom,

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,320
he's been in some of the biggest British TV dramas of the last

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600
two decades, Cold Feet, Murphy's Law and, of course,

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,320
The Missing. Now he's back in Stan Lee's Lucky Man,

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,840
lucky me, it's James Nesbitt.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,040
APPLAUSE There he is. Hello, sir.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,200
Lovely to see you, have a seat.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,240
She's an actress, comedian, singer and writer with a Bafta,

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,720
Golden Globe and seven Emmys to her name.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,480
Now, after 30 years, she's returning to the BBC

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,160
with a brand-new sketch show.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,760
It's the fabulous Tracey Ullman, everybody.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
APPLAUSE

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,320
Hello. It's like I'm welcoming you back on behalf of the nation.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,840
And he's one of Britain's finest actors. He moved us

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,000
in The English Patient, made us laugh in The Grand Budapest Hotel

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
and terrified us as Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films,

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
please welcome, for the first time to the show,

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
the great Ralph Fiennes, everybody.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
APPLAUSE

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Hello, sir, how are you? Very well.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
Greet each other, greet each other.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,200
That was just showbiz greeting, though.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
You have said hello back there, right?

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,320
Yes, we have, we did it all again.

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,560
You didn't sit back there going, "Don't look at them.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
"Keep it fresh, keep it fresh."

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Do you know each other? Do you...? We do.

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,760
- Ralph and I do. 
- I know you, yeah.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
- Not in the biblical sense.
- No.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,040
James, you were directed by Ralph.

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,280
I was directed by Ralph, I was beaten up by Ralph in the film,

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
a version of Shakespeare's Coriolanus, which was amazing.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
I was very scared, actually.

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,640
I hadn't done Shakespeare in a long time.

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,840
- You were brilliant in it.
- Since I was at drama school with you, actually,

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,520
- that's how long ago it was. 
- Wow! And how bad it was.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,360
- Were you at drama school together? 
- He was a bit older than me...

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
You'd never know it, all the same.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Yes, no, Ralph asked me to come.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,040
And it was brilliant, actually, we had a laugh.

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
It is a new year and

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,560
a very happy New Year for one James Nesbitt because you were on

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,240
- the Honours list.
- I was.
- You are.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
You're not struck off or anything.

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,880
- You're still on it, you're still on it.
- Depends how this show goes.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,080
- What did you get?
- I got an OBE. 
- Very good.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
APPLAUSE

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
- Actually, yes, cheers to that. 
- Any excuse.

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,360
Are your mum and dad both still around?

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, my mum's not around, no. Dad was very pleased. Dad said,

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
"About bloody time," actually.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,520
My friends, I think, were pleased.

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,560
One of them, Jason Ferguson, a very good friend of mine,

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,720
he said, "Order of the Bell End, about time."

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,120
It's exciting. It's a day out at the Palace for me and my girls.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you know who you're getting yet?

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,320
- You get different people, do you? 
- There's a whole family of them.

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,040
- There is, isn't there? There's loads of them.
- I wasn't aware of that.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,640
There's like a pack of cards.

86
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Where are you going?

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,680
I think you go to the Palace, do you?

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't know!

89
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll probably get Edward.

90
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,160
I will now!

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
You'll probably go, "Oh, sh..."

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
Ralph, you haven't got anything yet?

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,920
- No.
- No, no. I feel like you should.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,320
You are genuinely posh.

95
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,640
- He got one, he got one. 
- It's all surface.

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm not posh inside.

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
Tracey Ullman, I've a feeling, whatever chances you had...

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,360
- I ain't gettin' one!
- Yeah, you're really not getting one now.

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,800
No chance.

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,120
- No, because in the new show...
- Yeah.

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,640
- ..you do a version of one of them. 
- Yeah.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
- Do you?
- Ha, "do you?"

103
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Yes, Camilla.

104
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Yes, there I am.

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,200
Isn't that good? Isn't that amazing?

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,800
I had a lovely time being her. I will present you with your, er...

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,480
CBE. I'll do it now. I'll do it. Would you like her to do it?

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,320
- I love being her.
- It's quite specific, how she is.

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,640
What have you done? When do you do her?

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,720
Within my show, which comes out next Monday...

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
It's a sketch show, we'll talk about it more. Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
This is actually your bit, Ralph...

113
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,760
Don't shine the light there right now.

114
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Erm, genius, genius make-ups and things. I'm various people.

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
She's a tough character, your Camilla.

116
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,400
- PLUMMY ACCENT:
- Yes, she vapes a lot and she's, you know,

117
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,160
dealing with horses a lot, she picks up the phone and it's Charles

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
and says, "Hello, sexy."

119
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,600
We like her. It's very affectionate, VERY affectionate(!)

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm ain't going to get one of those things at the Palace.

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,280
- No, you're really not. 
- No, no, we all knew that.

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
Tracey Ullman, is it odd that

123
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
your very first show in America

124
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
was the one that spawned The Simpsons?

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,040
- Yes.
- Did you... Are you a creator of The Simpsons?

126
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
I breast-fed the yellow people.

127
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,160
Yeah. Yes.

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,880
We wanted little cartoon segments, you know, as bumpers on the show.

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,120
There was this blue hair of Marge, I remember that specifically.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,640
And then I was so busy doing all these parts

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,400
on the show they came and said,

132
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,160
"We need someone to record the voices, you know."

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,040
- AS MARGE:
- "OK, I'll do it."

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,920
This voice, so she was Marge.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,760
Then Dan Castellaneta said...

136
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
- AS HOMER:
- "OK, I don't mind, what do you want me to be?"

137
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,680
So he was Homer.

138
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,520
And that was it, that very first week.

139
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
And then, who knew?

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
I knew it was big.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,400
I think I went to Italy next summer for my holiday

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
and there was like Italian Simpsons a-bath foam.

143
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,120
- So anyway, yup, The Simpsons started on my show.
- Yes.

144
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,280
APPLAUSE

145
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,720
Now, Ralph Fiennes, how busy are you?!

146
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,400
We just enjoyed you in your last outing as M in Spectre.

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
You're sticking with that now.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,080
- You're M forever. For a while, anyway.
- I've got one more I think

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,520
and then it's up to them whether they want me back.

150
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,160
They'll want you back, they will. They'll want you back!

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,840
That's like your dream job, I mean, you were a Bond geek.

152
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,240
I was a Bond geek when I was a teenager, yeah

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,520
Is it true you would do trivia quizzes on...?

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,680
I knew all the Bond books inside out. I can't answer

155
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Mastermind questions now but I read them all least three times.

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,520
- Wow!
- I knew all about Kissy Suzuki and Solitaire

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,360
and Gala Brand and...Honeychile Rider and...

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Presumably you wanted to be HIM, not M.

159
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
Yes...

160
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Not to piss on your parade.

161
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,200
As a kid you weren't thinking, "Oh, one day I might be M."

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,560
- No, well, years go on... 
- You're in it, be happy.

163
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,000
- You're in a franchise, great! 
- I'm very happy.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400
Here's the thing, you are coming back to the stage,

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,920
and then it's all about you,

166
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,520
in The Master Builder. It's at the Old Vic, just round the corner here.

167
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,040
Previews on the 23rd of January, opening on the 3rd of February.

168
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,600
A glance, a cursory glance at this audience, and you can guess

169
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,800
- they know their Ibsen pretty well. 
- They know their Ibsen inside out(!)

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,840
For the couple of them who don't know,

171
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,760
what's The Master Builder about?

172
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,680
- A master builder.
- I'm glad. 
- Who's going through

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,320
- a midlife crisis.
- No!
- And into his life walks a young,

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,360
- 23-year-old girl.
- Ka-ching. 
- Ka-ching.

175
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Bums on seats, here we go.

176
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,440
Who wants him to build a very tall, erect tower that goes

177
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,480
high, high, high into the sky

178
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
and this is a proposal that excites him a lot.

179
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
You don't need to be Freud.

180
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm working with a fantastic young

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Australian actress called Sarah Snook,

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,280
who plays the young girl. She is seriously a gifted lady.

183
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,400
- She inspires you.
- She does, she inspires me to build a spire.

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Yes. See what we did there? All the way round.

185
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,800
Yes, very good. I suppose a lot of people...

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,880
I say a lot of people, me. ..would imagine that

187
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,560
when you get to the level of success you have achieved in films, there

188
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,880
would be a temptation to walk away from the heavy lifting of seven,

189
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
eight shows a week and the long stretch of that but, no,

190
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,560
you keep coming back to it.

191
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,920
Well, I love it. This is an amazing play, I believe.

192
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm working with the great director Matthew Warchus,

193
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,880
who's fantastic and, for me, there's nothing that beats being in front

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
of an audience, and feeling the play evolve in front of them,

195
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,160
you tell them a story and every night it's different.

196
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
You go on a journey and it's not the same as filming.

197
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
Have you been in The Master Builder?

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,160
Yeah, I played The Master Builder at drama school.

199
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
How tall was your spire?

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,440
It drooped a wee bit, to tell the truth.

201
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,120
I hear that you've never had any complaints...

202
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,280
- That was the OBE. 
- The bells make up for it.

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,920
No, I erm...

204
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,760
In fact, you should have seen it when we were at drama school.

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
I was in the year above you.

206
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
I probably did!

207
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,720
George Hall...

208
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
Yes, no, the PERFORMANCE!

209
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,480
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

210
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,320
All the students were talking.

211
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,720
George Hall, who was the director, who was the head of Central,

212
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,040
his critique afterwards, he looked at me and said,

213
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,920
"Jimmy, you missed."

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,520
So it wasn't a great performance, I give.

215
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,320
So I hope you'll do better. I'm sure you'll do better.

216
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,400
"The reviews are in. Ralph Fiennes, you missed."

217
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
That is pretty great.

218
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,560
Was it in a Shakespeare play

219
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,000
where you had your costume... What do you call that thing?

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,120
What do they call it? A wardrobe malfunction.

221
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
I had a major wardrobe malfunction.

222
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,560
It was in a Shakespeare play, a comedy called Love's Labours Lost,

223
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,120
and I played a character

224
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,520
called Berowne who has an amazing speech about love.

225
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,600
Very romantic speech, full of ardour.

226
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,840
It's off the back of a very high-comedic farcical scene

227
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,160
and suddenly it stops and he launches into this lyrical passage

228
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,840
about how important it is to love women.

229
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,440
And, erm, I had these very tight

230
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,400
moleskin britches and, as I got into my stride, they split...

231
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,680
- Oi!
- ..down the middle.

232
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,960
But that's an odd place for them to split.

233
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
What can I tell you?

234
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,720
GRAHAM LAUGHS HEARTILY

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm glad I was not going commando that day and I had red...

236
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,440
..polka-dot underpants on.

237
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,640
Did people think it was meant to happen?

238
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,600
No. They enjoyed it.

239
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,120
Were you tempted to do it every night after that?

240
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,520
I was on with three other actors,

241
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,080
barely holding it together. Finally I got to the end of

242
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
the speech and we got a round of applause.

243
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
I've been in panto, I bet

244
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,240
- you've not done bloody panto. 
- No. A matter of time.

245
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,680
30 years ago I was Dick Whittington in Newcastle.

246
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,280
- That's theatre for you. 
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

247
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,840
I got a bit chubby cos I got a bit depressed up there,

248
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,080
I was eating at this tearoom a lot, Carrick's.

249
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,000
I used to go on, I got a bit chubby in my stockings, you know,

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,080
Dick Whittington,

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I'd go, "Hello, children. Are you going to be my friend?"

252
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,680
One of the kids went...

253
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,960
- GEORDIE ACCENT:
- "No, fuck off, Jumbo!"

254
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
That's theatre for you. When they talk back.

255
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
"Right, what's your name?" "Terry."

256
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,760
Annoying little bastard in the front, you know.

257
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,160
All the nuns are in with the coach party and it was horrible.

258
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,240
- You've been scarred by that. 
- Oh, I've been scarred by it.

259
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Scarred. Ralph, you haven't given up film because your new movie is

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,840
- A Bigger Splash.
- Yup. 
- When does that...?

261
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,480
12th of February, 12th of February.

262
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,280
It's a fantastic cast, you can see there.

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,080
Tilda Swinton, Dakota Johnson, yourself,

264
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,120
- Matthias Schoenaerts?
- Schoenaerts.

265
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,080
Now, it's almost a love quadrangle.

266
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Love quadrangle, yeah.

267
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,560
I don't think I've ever seen you play a part like this before,

268
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,040
you're kind of wild in this.

269
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
- I'm a wild and crazy guy. 
- You really are.

270
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,040
LAUGHTER

271
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,080
The idea is, people who kind of share a romantic history

272
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,040
are all thrown together on a Greek island...

273
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,800
- It's an Italian island.
- An Italian island, not a Greek island.

274
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,840
- Pantelleria. It's an island between Sicily and Tunisia.
- OK.

275
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,880
Near Greece. And, erm...

276
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,080
- Oh, Graham.
- That was tense, I think.

277
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,160
Your character... The idea is you're trying to rekindle a romance.

278
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,440
- I've come back to reclaim Tilda Swinton.
- Who's a rock star.

279
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,200
Who is a rock star on holiday, recovering from a throat operation

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,160
with her younger boyfriend lover, Matthias Schoenaerts.

281
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,840
I was her beau in the past and we split up,

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,560
and I passed my friend Matthias on to Tilda.

283
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,320
I've put them together and gone and now I've come back to reclaim her.

284
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Cos I realise I made a big mistake.

285
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,400
This is the clip from The Biggest Splash and, in fact,

286
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,960
it is a night on the town just

287
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,680
when you're starting to woo Tilda's character,

288
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
who's resting her voice.

289
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,960
# If I had her

290
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,120
# In my hands your body and soul

291
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
WHOOPING

292
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,120
- SHE WHISPERS: 
- # Come, come, come to me

293
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,760
CROWD FINISHES LYRIC

294
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,960
- SHE WHISPERS: 
- # Come, come, come to me

295
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,520
SHE WHISPERS

296
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,440
# Come, come, come to me

297
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
SHE STUMBLES

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,240
# Come, come, come to me... #

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
SHE WHISPERS

300
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,000
CROWD CHANTS

301
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,000
Very good. APPLAUSE

302
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,200
In it, you're very kind of relaxed, very free, you're very...

303
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
We see a lot of you.

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
We see your spire.

305
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
In miniature, I think.

306
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
No, it's fine, it's all there. It's all there.

307
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
The potential is there.

308
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,200
The sequel.

309
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,800
- Completely naked? Everything? 
- Everything.
- The old chap?

310
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,080
- The old chap.
- Wow, good for you!

311
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,920
- No messing.
- Usually it's just the girls, I'm proud of you.

312
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,360
- Oh, no, Tilda does it too. 
- She does it.

313
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
Girls always do.

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,960
Tracey Ullman, have you ever...? Have you ever... ?

315
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,080
No, no, I've not done it. Prosthetic ones, I do prosthetic ones.

316
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,800
- Yes.
- No, I've never been asked. 
- Would you?
- Would you?

317
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,240
No.

318
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,960
You're being asked now. Look, Ralph Fiennes is asking you.

319
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,520
I will for you.

320
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,160
I'll sit over here on my own.

321
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,960
We've seen you, you've done the TV nudity. We saw it in Cold Feet.

322
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,200
You did it too? Oh, that's is just bum, not the old chap.

323
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,800
- Is that you?
- Yeah, that is really you, isn't it?

324
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,760
Your audience has really waited too long to see that again.

325
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,960
The last job I did...

326
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,480
When I did it with that guy, when I did it there,

327
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,200
the dresser that fitted it was a guy called Greg, a big...

328
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
unusually, in the business, a big butch lad from Australia, actually.

329
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,320
Oh, no, from Manchester called Greg.

330
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,320
His name is pasted into the buttocks of my memory.

331
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,320
He spent all day having to reapply, to re-stick the rose there.

332
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,600
After that job he disappeared, he went to Australia!

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No-one has ever heard from him since! The last job

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,520
I've just finished in Belfast, I had to do a fair amount of...

335
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,360
a day of sort of...

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,280
nudity and sex scenes and stuff but they covered my bits with a wee...

337
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
I shouldn't say a "wee".

338
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,280
So Northern Irish Protestant, "wee," you think...

339
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,800
With a pouch that kept coming apart. So again the dresser,

340
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,960
Sophie she was called, she had to spend a day kind of reapplying...

341
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,720
These jobs aren't easy. I am sure that's not why she

342
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,160
- went into the business. 
- It's not for the faint hearted.

343
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,880
No, she can't have thought, "Oh, look what I am doing today!"

344
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,280
The new Cold Feet, are the scripts ready? Have you started filming?

345
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,760
What's happening?

346
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,720
No, we start in... Old Feet.

347
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
We start in three weeks' time.

348
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
- Wow.
- We've got a read-through next week.

349
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,880
I haven't seen a lot of them for, you know...

350
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,040
Well, I haven't seen loads of them for 12 years, really.

351
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,480
I mean, we didn't sort of get together. We didn't

352
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,920
sort of deliberately keep apart, it's just the nature of the thing.

353
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,080
We are going to see each other

354
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,320
in two weeks and the scripts look good, they've tried

355
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
to get us to do it for a number of years. I think it wasn't

356
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,120
quite ready, they hadn't

357
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,960
quite sorted out the various zeros on the cheques.

358
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,360
We're very excited to do it.

359
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,760
It was weird, I just saw Helen Baxendale, she was just in Midsomer Murders.

360
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, she's not in it, of course, cos she died.

361
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,800
Of course, she died.

362
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,560
She survived in Midsomer Murders, that's a feat

363
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,520
for a guest star! Well done her.

364
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,400
We've been waiting 12 years for new Cold Feet,

365
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,920
but we've been waiting even longer

366
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,280
- for Tracey Ullman to get back on the BBC, it's 30 years.
- 30 years!

367
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,480
You must be shocked that it's 30 years.

368
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,160
I mean, I just never got offered a job in this country.

369
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,680
Seriously, I'm always coming and going. I was really flattered to

370
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,160
be asked, and Charlotte Moore is the head of BBC One, and Myfanwy Moore

371
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
is the head of comedy,

372
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,920
these two girls just asked me to come in and said,

373
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,880
"Is there anything you'd like to do?"

374
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
The last time I was at the BBC,

375
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
it was all men in bow ties doing The Goons.

376
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,800
"What, what, what? We need more national service jokes."

377
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,160
It was!

378
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,440
"Can you be a traffic warden? Ha-ha-ha!"

379
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,320
I had a good time. I had a great time with Lenny and David,

380
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,480
it was a long time ago.

381
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,120
Then various things happened.

382
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,880
I was back at the BBC,

383
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,840
I have absolutely loved it, I've had a brilliant time.

384
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,720
- This is Tracey Ullman's Show. 
- Yes, Tracey Ullman's Show.

385
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
It starts next Monday at 10:45.

386
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,640
It's funny... I was saying to you outside,

387
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,440
it is hard to come up with a sketch show that has fresh characters in it

388
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,920
but this is...it really does.

389
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,200
Well, it's Britain today. To me, it's a melting pot,

390
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,240
it's this global hub, it's a 24-hour period of Britain,

391
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,600
and people come in and people go out

392
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,880
and people try and get in and people get thrown out...

393
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,520
Famous people within it,

394
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,880
there's a through story of what happens from dawn to dusk.

395
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,640
It's tonnes of different things.

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Lots of impersonations, which I have never really done before.

397
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, no, but... Now, the famous people...

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
You do people like Dame Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Angela Merkel.

399
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
The Angela Merkel, there's a sitcom in Angela Merkel. There really...

400
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,480
You just want more and more of Angela Merkel.

401
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,440
- There she is.
- There's Angela Merkel.

402
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,840
- GERMAN ACCENT:
- That's right, Angela Merkel, I love her,

403
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,280
I think that she's always with men all the time,

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,800
with Berlusconi and Cameron and Obama,

405
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
and she wants to just be with girls. I got this idea that I think

406
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,520
she thinks she's very sexy.

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,280
Everybody is...right now... I am sex bomb, sex bomb...

408
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,320
..when I'm in the room.

409
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
And then I wanted to do her with her friend.

410
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,800
She does her arms like this. Anyway.

411
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,400
I digress. She sings and everything, we discovered.

412
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,520
- She sings beautifully. 
- She is terrific.

413
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,040
- Ja.
- She is terrific. 
- Eurovision winner 1982.

414
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,480
Called A Little Peace. Remember that song? Ja, was wonderful...wunderbar.

415
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,360
Anyway, I don't know, I wanted to be her, so I am her.

416
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,680
Do you come up with the funny bit first? Like the joke or

417
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,240
do you kind of think, "I can do them, write me something funny for them?"

418
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah, I wanted to be a series of national treasures,

419
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,760
cos that's what we have in this country.

420
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,240
Kevin and Andy, Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley,

421
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,600
came up with the wonderful idea that,

422
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,040
- JUDI DENCH VOICE:
- Judi Dench can get away with anything

423
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,320
because she's a national treasure. So she can shoplift.

424
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Then I got this brilliant make-up, and then it comes from there.

425
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,560
- Anyway.
- We've got a clip, this

426
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,680
is you as Dame Judi Dench being a

427
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,880
national treasure at the supermarket.

428
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,000
Oi! I saw that, do you want me to call the police?

429
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,520
I don't know what you mean.

430
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,640
- Oh, it's you, isn't it?
- If you mean, "Is it Dame Judi Dench?"

431
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
then, yes, it is. How very nice to meet you.

432
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
Sorry about that.

433
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
There must be something wrong with the security camera.

434
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,280
Yes, well, they can be temperamental.

435
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
I loved you in James Bond.

436
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,240
Oh, we just try to tell a good story. And thank you.

437
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,360
What was I thinking? Dame Judi Dench wouldn't shoplift.

438
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,760
- You're a national treasure.
- Exactly.

439
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,840
And because I'm a national treasure, I could get away with anything!

440
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,160
But, of course, I don't. What is that over there?

441
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,120
- My mistake.
- It's an honour meeting you.
- Yes. Lovely to meet you too.

442
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,000
You have such a lovely shop here.

443
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,240
SHE CACKLES

444
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,320
APPLAUSE That was uncanny, wasn't it?

445
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,840
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant make-up,

446
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,200
Floris my genius make-up artist. We were

447
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
filming in Richmond, actually.

448
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,480
WHOOPING Big up the Richmond!

449
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,760
Somebody from Richmond? Yeah, how lovely. I might do panto there

450
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,600
this year. People thought we were filming something from Bond.

451
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,960
A couple of them got convinced.

452
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,440
You know Dame Judi Dench.

453
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,560
What's she going to make of it, Ralph?

454
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,160
- I think she'll love it. 
- Oh, thank God! Really?

455
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,480
She might start shoplifting, actually.

456
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,840
She's going to become a shoplifter.

457
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,160
They'll want her back on Bond.

458
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,640
- You were in it together. 
- We were in it together.

459
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,280
- Right.
- She wasn't happy that I took over as M.

460
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,840
- Really?
- Oh. Why not?

461
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,280
- Well, cos I replaced her.
- Oh.

462
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,960
In fairness, that would piss you off.

463
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,720
So, she...

464
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
In the first one I appeared in, my name is Mallory,

465
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,600
so a way of getting back to me was to call me Valerie.

466
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,320
Any time I meet her she would say, "Hello, Valerie!"

467
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,720
And she nicks things from your house.

468
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,040
So if you stay in that Judi Dench make-up all day,

469
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,640
you obviously don't mind the prosthetics and the costumes

470
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,400
because, Ralph, you hate prosthetics and things, don't you?

471
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,160
- I don't love them, no. 
- You choose jobs to avoid them.

472
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,520
- After Voldemort, I did, I have. Yup, yup.
- It's hard.
- How much

473
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
of it is prosthetics on Voldemort?

474
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,560
Actually, to be honest, on Voldemort not so much.

475
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,800
- A lot of painting and...
- Oi-oi-oi.

476
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,280
- Very little, actually! 
- Teeth, the eyes...

477
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,080
More or less... I see what you mean.

478
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,240
- Latex round the eyes.
- They shaved the beard off, right?

479
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,360
Wasn't there a moment when

480
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,200
you knew the Voldemort look was working when you were on set?

481
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah, I passed by...

482
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,560
The script supervisor has a little boy who was on set.

483
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,320
- His son, maybe?
- Her, her son, I think four or five years old.

484
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,160
Anyway, I passed by this little child, I looked at this boy,

485
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,680
he just burst into tears.

486
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,640
The costume must have helped as well because it's quite frightening.

487
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
The costume actually wasn't...

488
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,480
It was just a lot of flowing silky stuff

489
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,280
that I kept tripping over.

490
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,600
I had these tights on underneath.

491
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,080
- They were like ladies' tights. 
- And they ripped in the middle!

492
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,320
LAUGHTER DROWNS OUT SPEECH

493
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,560
- No, they didn't rip. 
- I like that they were ladies' tights!

494
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,440
Are there other sorts of tights?

495
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,960
- They're not the sort of tights you wear at the RSC.
- Oh, OK.

496
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,560
You did have a problem.

497
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,120
What happened was the tights used to work their way down,

498
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,240
so the gusset of the tight was sort of around my knees.

499
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
So I couldn't walk as elegantly as I would like as Voldemort.

500
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,760
Eventually I said to the dresser, he was called Neil,

501
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,920
he was very sweet. He always had his head up my skirt

502
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,120
trying to adjust things. I said, would he mind cutting them off?

503
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
So I had a garter belt.

504
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,680
For most of Harry Potter, underneath the robes,

505
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,920
I had a very nice garter belt.

506
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,120
You've spoiled it for everybody now.

507
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,200
Now, here's the thing, James Nesbitt. In the Hobbit,

508
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
I look at this picture of you in The Hobbit,

509
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
I think, "Well, that's not bad, it's a hat and a beard,"

510
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,080
but, in fact, there was loads of prosthetics went on.

511
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,720
Oh, aye, there were early starts in the morning.

512
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,280
It took quite a while.

513
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,560
If you are doing it for... It was astonishing, the look and the way

514
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,480
they create it, and I admire and applaud the incredible detail and

515
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,920
- artistry, but...
- But!

516
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,600
After two years, it takes a wee...

517
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,800
You sent us a picture of what... So underneath...

518
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,920
- But you can't see any of that.
- That was me getting up in the morning.

519
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
How long did it take altogether?

520
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,920
The whole thing every morning,

521
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,000
I suppose, about three and a half hours long.

522
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,400
- Listen, beats working for a living!
- I would like to be in

523
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,240
a film... No, I wouldn't.

524
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
Not easy being me, terrible.

525
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,320
Is it true that they in fact didn't really want you to

526
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,800
look like you in The Hobbit?

527
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,560
Thank you, yes.

528
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,320
But there is some truth to that.

529
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,240
Wasn't there a dinner?

530
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Oh, no, no, no, that was because...

531
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,080
I constantly... And, in fact, twice today, every day I get

532
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,360
confused with the actor John Hannah.

533
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,680
John Hannah who was in... I don't think I look like him at all.

534
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,360
We've got a picture of John Hannah. Where is he?

535
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,680
Oh, come on!

536
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,440
- You do look a bit...
- I wouldn't mind looking like him there!

537
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,000
He looks quite well.

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,640
We are the spit of each other!

539
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
I get it all the time and right at the beginning of The Hobbit

540
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,000
I went for a private dinner with Peter Jackson and his partner and

541
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,360
one of the heads of Warner Brothers who were behind the movie.

542
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,120
I walked in and he said,

543
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,400
"I am so excited you are involved in The Hobbit,

544
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,560
"I loved you so much in Sliding Doors."

545
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,200
I was like, "That's not me!"

546
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,280
I've still never really understood.

547
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,600
Did he think they'd cast John Hannah?

548
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,240
I sign John's name quite often, he signs mine.

549
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
It gets to the point where people come up to me

550
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,080
and go, "I loved you in Four Weddings and a Funeral," I say,

551
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,040
"Yes, that Auden poem, it's so beautiful.

552
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,840
"Blah, blah, blah, Stop All The Clocks, John Hannah."

553
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,440
Quite often I'll do James Nesbitt, and you see them walking

554
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,400
away and going, "Oh, man..."

555
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,320
What do you get? You get someone.

556
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,920
- I get mistaken for Liam Neeson. 
- Oh, you do?
- And he does for me,

557
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,880
I have been complimented in my performance in Taken 2.

558
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,760
I get, "You were wonderful in Educating Rita! So much fun."

559
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,280
Do you really get Julie Walters?

560
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,320
Yeah, everyone thinks I'm Julie Walters.

561
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,760
- I don't have a picture of Julie Walters.
- I do look like her.

562
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
We've got a Liam Neeson, we've got a Liam Neeson

563
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,360
but I don't think you do look particularly like Liam Neeson.

564
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,000
Well...no. Hmm...

565
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,040
Apparently, they've got one thing in common, those two boys.

566
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
That's all I'm saying.

567
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,760
Scratches head, doesn't understand.

568
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,640
Does he get confused for you?

569
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,400
Yes, he's been complimented on his English Patient.

570
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,880
Everything sounds rude.

571
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,480
It does with Liam and Ralph.

572
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,240
Being in the Hobbit, a big franchise like that,

573
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
did it make you a cool dad for your girls?

574
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,320
No, they're much cooler and funnier than me.

575
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,240
The eldest one, from a very early age, she was very funny.

576
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,200
She was startlingly quick at being able to speak.

577
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,000
She was talking when she was just two.

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,840
She had a sense of humour very early on.

579
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,840
There was one time when I was driving when she was two and a half,

580
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,280
it was just the two of us in the car and I was driving and

581
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,600
I broke wind.

582
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,800
But there was this five-second pause and, on my daughters' lives,

583
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,840
from the back of the car came,

584
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
"Another Minging Fart by James Nesbitt."

585
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,320
- Two and a half!
- That's good.

586
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,840
Where does that come from?

587
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,160
Tracey, you seem to like the idea of being an embarrassing mother.

588
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,040
You do... You just become a permanent figure of fun as you get

589
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,120
older with your kids.

590
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,160
I did something really embarrassing with my kid Johnny as few years ago

591
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,040
when I was still having to buy him swimming trunks for his holiday.

592
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,600
You know, you take the kid to buy swimming trunks, he's like,

593
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,520
"Come on, let's go." I took him to this kind of fancy boutique place

594
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
around the corner, they didn't have anything, really.

595
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,400
You know, it was like Speedos and he's not

596
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,680
a Speedo kind of kid, he needs something with a bit of

597
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,080
an elasticated waist, a quick-dry gusset.

598
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,840
I should have gone to British Home Stores

599
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,720
but I thought I'd take him somewhere nice.

600
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,200
I saw this very gorgeous young black assistant

601
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,320
amongst the rails doing stuff. I said, "Excuse me, can you help me?

602
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,920
"My son's looking for something, elasticated waist, quick dry gusset.

603
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,000
"He's a little chunk star." And Johnny's going, "Mum, Mum, Mum."

604
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,400
I'm going, "Johnny, I'm going to ask the man,

605
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,960
"let me just, let me just..."

606
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
"Mum, Mum, Mum, it's Kanye West."

607
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,200
Now that's embarrassing, that.

608
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,800
I didn't know.

609
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,200
He was very nice but he was holding something...

610
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
He went, you know,

611
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,760
"I guess you think I'm cool. I'm working in this store.

612
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,480
"That's OK. He thinks I'm cool." Oi-oi-oi!

613
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,880
Poor Johnny. I didn't give it up.

614
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,080
I saw him getting in the lift, I was like,

615
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,280
"Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry about that." Johnny was like, "Enough now!"

616
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,520
This was British Home Stores?

617
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,840
Then I just went to British Home Stores.

618
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,760
- Would have been better if it was. 
- Take the kid to...

619
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,680
Well, James Nesbitt, supercool now,

620
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,920
because he's bringing us Sky 1's big adaptation of Stan Lee's

621
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,160
Lucky Man, which starts on Friday, January the 22nd.

622
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,520
Of course, this is Stan Lee, he created all the Marvel characters.

623
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,480
He co-created Spider-Man and Thor and Iron Man and Captain America,

624
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,840
all those things,

625
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,720
quite a long time ago. This was something he had always thought of.

626
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,440
He used to be asked, "What would your superpower be?"

627
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,760
He liked the idea of controlling luck.

628
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,880
This is a contemporary sort of quite glossy,

629
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,400
fast-moving thriller set in London,

630
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,520
in which London plays a big part, actually, and it looks amazing,

631
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,120
about a cop who's down on his luck,

632
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,080
he's a compulsive gambler, this is who I play.

633
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,200
And he meets this mysterious woman who, after

634
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
spending a night with her at a casino,

635
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,560
where he has finally won some money, he spends the night with her,

636
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,840
he wakes up in the morning with this ancient bracelet upon his wrist,

637
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,680
which seems to be able to control luck.

638
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,000
But there is a price to pay. It's very much of that genre.

639
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
But for you it must be just fun. As an actor, you must love doing it.

640
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,360
It was just magic. Particularly on the back of stuff I had done

641
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,880
recently, this was very different.

642
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,080
The notion of luck is something that appeals to all of us,

643
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,720
you know. What is it? Does it exist?

644
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,840
Can we control it? There is a thriller element to it.

645
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,720
London just looks amazing.

646
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,000
It really does, it looks so slick and beautiful.

647
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,920
The Shard has got a bigger part than me.

648
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,480
The Shard features prominently - the spire!

649
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,680
Oh, yes!

650
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,000
Quite often I realised the director was going,

651
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
"And could you just move...

652
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,800
"just maybe step just to your right a bit?"

653
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,280
And I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, I see."

654
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,680
Listen, this is such an action clip.

655
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,200
It's a real kind of proper James Bond speedboat.

656
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,000
- As close as I'll get.
- But you're really doing the speedboat.

657
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Oh, no, I was doing it. And in these days of health and safety,

658
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,280
it's astonishing that this was allowed to happen, because when you

659
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,640
watch this, I am doing it and I am scared,

660
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,600
and the boat was more in control of me than I was

661
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,520
in control of the boat. Which is terrifying.

662
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,880
And we're going through the Thames Barrier, I think,

663
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,960
- at three in the morning. 
- OK, let's have a look.

664
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,720
Harry, stay back.

665
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
Get down.

666
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Slow down.

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,440

- There's not enough room!

- Ooh!
- Wow.

670
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,280
When I'm driving the boat there, there's a man sort of at my knees,

671
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,720
and at one point he was going, "Jesus, slow down, slow down!"

672
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,280
GRAHAM CACKLES

673
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,960
"Not funny, not funny."

674
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,360
All right, it's time for music. Now, this man...

675
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,480
Wait for this as a statistic.

676
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,880
This man's debut album Chaos and the Calm

677
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
was top ten in 51 countries.

678
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
Yeah. Now he's got three Grammy nominations.

679
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,960

CHEERING

727
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,120
James Bay, everybody. Come on over, James.

728
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,720
Drop your gee-tar.

729
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,640
Wow, energy to burn. Congratulations. James, that's James.

730
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,840
- Nice to meet you. 
- Tracey, that's Ralph.

731
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,320
- Amazing.
- Thank you. That was fun. Thank you so much.

732
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,600
Wow! The energy of that! That was fantastic, thank you so much.

733
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,640
Ay, it's an honour to kick off the year.

734
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,240
Well... You've kicked us off, I tell you.

735
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,960
That is of course from the album Chaos and the Calm.

736
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,720
It's still for sale but presumably everyone's got it now.

737
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
It sold amazingly well.

738
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,960
- Yeah, it's, erm...
- Just go with yes. 
- Yes.

739
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,480
It is mad to think how many people have it, yeah,

740
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,400
that's an exciting thing.

741
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,840
Must say, good luck with the Grammys. When are the Grammys?

742
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
It's like Valentine's Day. Or the day after.

743
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,480
I think that's...how I remembered it.

744
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,120
- I think it's the 15th of February. 
- 15th of February.

745
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Listen, someone will make sure you're there.

746
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,040
It would be really annoying if you missed it.

747
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
"I was sure it was the 15th!"

748
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,520
I'll try and get there.

749
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,840
Thanks for doing that great performance and

750
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,640
good luck on the 15th of February.

751
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,360
All right, thanks a lot. James Bay. Very good.

APPLAUSE

753
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,880
Before we go, just time for our first visit of the year

754
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,040
to the big red chair.

755
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,640
- Who's there? Hello.
- Hello. 
- What's your name?
- Graham.
- Is it? OK.

756
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,440
- Where are you from, Graham? 
- I'm from Glasgow, originally.

757
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,160
OK, lovely and where do you live now?

758
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Well, I'm currently working in London.

759
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,560
OK, what do you do?

760
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,640
I'm a brand manager for a well-known pharmaceutical company.

761
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,840
(Boots.)

762
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,040
We can't be sure it's (Boots) but it probably is.

763
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,520
All right, Graham, off you go with your story.

764
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,200
The first thing you need to know is my girlfriend and I

765
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,640
were butt-naked in bed.

766
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,760
- Good start to any story. 
- Good start!
- Very good start.

767
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Non-exclusive, though.

768
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,720
We were in a train carriage travelling through South Africa

769
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,280
and it was one of those really quite

770
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,080
old locomotives, so it was like an old carriage, wooden,

771
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,600
and they had a partition door.

772
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,280
During the night, my girlfriend nudges me and says,

773
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,440
"Did you hear that?" I'm like, "No, I didn't hear anything."

774
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,000
I had to get up and check, obviously.

775
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Being completely naked, I got up and tried to put my trousers on

776
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,640
because I didn't want to tackle bandits stark naked.

777
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,080
Obviously.

778
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,920
And, all of a sudden, the train starts to slow down

779
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,280
and, with it being an old coach system, they started to collide

780
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,240
together like a domino effect,

781
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,040
and that sent me careering through the partition door straight

782
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,560
into the next cabin

783
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,600
and I landed straight on top of the woman that was in the other cabin.

784
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,040
Now, it's at that moment

785
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,320
when her husband woke up and looked at me and I realised I was

786
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,760
sitting on his wife's face.

787
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,880
Ooh!

788
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,440
- Good story!
- Good story.
- Good story. You can walk, you can walk.

789
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,840
Well done. If you would like to join us on the show and have

790
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,280
a go in that big red chair, you can, just contact us

792
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,400
That is it for tonight.

Please, say a big thank you to my guests Mr James Bay...
