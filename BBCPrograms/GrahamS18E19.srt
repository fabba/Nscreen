1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Aww. It's Valentine's weekend and romance is in the air.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,800
I've got a letter from someone in the audience.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,200
Now, their partner knows nothing about this.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,320
The letter asks,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,520
"Can I propose to my loved one on national television?"

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
DRUMROLL

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,880
No.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,400
Let's start the show! APPLAUSE

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,880
Hello, hello!

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,880
Good evening, everybody!

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,160
Welcome to the show!

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,640
Some really relieved faces over there.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,040
LAUGHTER

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,320
"Urghh... Ah, it's OK."

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
Great guests for you tonight.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,800
An Oscar-winning actress, Britain's most loved double act

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,880
and one of my favourite comedy stars, who's in a great new romcom.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,320
Perfect for Valentine's weekend!

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
- AUDIENCE:
- Oooh!

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,240
Aw, Valentines!

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,040
The time of the year when you look into your partner's eyes

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,840
and say those magical words -

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,880
"You'll do."

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,040
Has everyone sent their Valentine's cards? Have they sent them?

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,680
FAINT WHOOP Wow. Love is in the air in here(!)

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,400
"What? What's he talking about?"

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,680
It's strange, you know? On Valentine's Day,

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
you can write a sexy, anonymous message to a virtual stranger

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,400
and it's romantic.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,560
But here's a tip - the rest of the year, that's stalking.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,520
Everyone wants to do something special on Valentine's Day,

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,760
but don't leave it till the last minute,

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,320
or everything is booked up and you end up...

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh, I don't know - going to a free recording of a television show.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,640
You know who you are!

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,680
Let's welcome the guests on!

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Later, we'll be having music from double Brit nominated Little Mix!

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,160
But first, one of Hollywood's hottest comedy stars

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,000
thanks to break-out roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Now, she's here to tell us How To Be Single.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,240
Please welcome the hilarious Rebel Wilson!

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
- Wow!
- Woo!

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,400
- Wow!
- I know!
- Look at you!

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello, darling. Lovely to see you. Shiny. Rebel Wilson!

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,080
CHEERING

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
From Byker Grove to I'm A Celebrity,

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,200
these two have been entertaining the nation for nearly 30 years

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,840
and have become one of Britain's most loved television double acts.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,120
Please welcome the multi-award-winning Ant and Dec!

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Hello, lovely to see you.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,520
- 30 years.
- Is it?
- You're old. You're older than I am.
- 30 years?!

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
We've loved this actress in so many great films -

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
The Big Lebowski, Boogie Nights, The Hours

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
and last year's Oscar-winning performance in Still Alice.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,840
Her latest film is the powerful drama, Freeheld.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,280
It's a warm welcome back to Julianne Moore!

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Good couch.

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,520
- It's very nice to see you all. 
- It's nice to see you too.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,240
And it's sort of Geordie land in a Hollywood lady sandwich.

64
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah!

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
With a Geordie filling.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,080
Julianne, last time you were here, we teased you,

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,880
because you had lost so many Oscars.

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,200
- Yeah.
- But now, loser no more!

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,720
- Because she had lost loads of them. 
- I'd lost... Yeah. Four of them. Lost four.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,320
That's careless, isn't it?

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,560
But now, big winner. Big winner for Still Alice. Congratulations!

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
Thank you.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,880
Was it everything you'd hoped, on the night?

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,800
- Or was it an anti-climax after waiting all that time?
- It was...

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,240
No, it was great. It was very exciting.

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,480
I tried to stay calm and present,

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
but you know, it's three hours long!

79
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
And I was the very last award before best film,

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,800
so it was agonising, yeah.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,720
I have to say, I do know all about losing. Ant and Dec...

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
LAUGHTER

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,000
How many National Television Awards have you won now?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
- Um... 15, in a row.
- Wow!

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,920
It's pretty good.

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,840
"In a row" is irrelevant.

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,600
15?!

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
It's brilliant, it's brilliant.

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
But look, my heart doesn't bleed for you.

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,920
You've won a few awards yourself.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,520
You've got a BAFTA in your opening titles.

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Which we were just throwing into a pond.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,040
- You've won Lifetime Achievement - is it twice now?
- Yeah.

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,120
Is that for both lives? Is that how that works?

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,480
I don't know what it's called.

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,880
We won something and it was some sort of Outstanding Contribution

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,640
or something and then we won it again a couple of years ago,

98
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,840
so I don't quite understand how that works.

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,320
Nor do I!

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
I really don't.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Have you ever had to do loser face?

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,400
- Oh, yeah, we've had to. 
- Over the years, yeah.

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,800
- Rebel, do you have a loser face? 
- Uh...

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,120
Well, I haven't been nominated yet for an Oscar,

105
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,600
cos they're racists.

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
LAUGHTER

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
So, I haven't...

108
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,880
Um...

109
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,280
I guess if I went to the Oscars and then I lost,

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,960
I'd just be like...

111
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,520
- show a tit, or something. 
- LAUGHTER

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
At least I'd get a lot of attention

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,680
and wouldn't feel like the night was a total waste.

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,520
Rather than just doing the classic...

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,560
- Yeah, just get a tit out. 
- Yeah, do it.

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,560
Nominated next year.

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,480
There you go - NTA awards.

118
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Just a peek of nip, through the shirt.

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,040
But Rebel, you do go to awards.

120
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,440
Was it an awards show where you were sat next to Kelly Osbourne?

121
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,520
That was Jennifer Lopez's opening night in Las Vegas, a couple of weeks ago.

122
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,920
- You get about, don't you? 
- Yeah, yeah.

123
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I mean, I still haven't found love, so I try to get out there.

124
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,320
You and Kelly were kind of looking for love?

125
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah, and then we noticed Justin Bieber was sitting

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,840
two rows behind us and we thought, you know what?

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,680
Valentine's Day is coming up, we're both single,

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,760
let's just make a play for him.

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,800
At first, we thought it would be funny, but then it actually worked.

130
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,720
And we sent Justin an note through our bodyguard...

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
- I think we've got the note. 
- Oh, really?

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,120
LAUGHTER

133
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
And then....

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,760
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

135
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,880
As you can see from exhibit A,

136
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,840
it is ticked seven times, yes?

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,360
So, I believe that means seven dates he owes me. Uh...

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,120
And I'm thinking horse riding, or a private pool party.

139
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,320
He hasn't got back in touch with me about the actual date

140
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,520
and I should probably stop talking about it,

141
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,240
cos you're going to think I'm really weird.

142
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,320
But you did get a picture taken with him?

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,120
- Yeah, we hung out all night. 
- Oh, did you? And here you are.

144
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,160
I think most girls meet Justin and be like, "Ahh!"

145
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,720
And be a bit pathetic, but I met him and just was like,

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,400
"Hey, what's up?"

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,360
LAUGHTER

148
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,480
I had really good game. Yeah, I was quite proud of myself.

149
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
He still looks quite nervous.

150
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,960
No, no - that's just because I was holding his balls.

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,840
LAUGHTER

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,800
APPLAUSE

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, let's talk about Julianne's new movie, Freeheld.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,320
It's released February 19th in cinemas and On Demand.

155
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
Now, your last movie, Still Alice,

156
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,960
dealt with the very difficult subject of early onset dementia.

157
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,080
So, this time, what have you brought us?

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Marriage equality and cancer.

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,120
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,560
Actually, it's a really, really wonderful movie

161
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,120
and it's based on a true story of this woman named Laurel Hester,

162
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,800
who was a police detective in New Jersey

163
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
and she wanted to leave her pension

164
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
to her younger partner, Stacie Andree,

165
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,080
when she was diagnosed with lung cancer.

166
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,160
And the county officials turned her down.

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,640
This only happened ten years ago, when it really was their fight

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,320
during the last year of Laurel's life that changed history

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,440
and really paved the way for marriage equality in the United States.

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
And it is a really uplifting and inspiring story,

171
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,440
but you have that quality that you take something

172
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,800
that should be quite depressing and make it luminous and inspiring.

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Aw, thank you.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
She was a really inspiring person, Laurel Hester -

175
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,960
and it was an honour to get to play her.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
And really, it is about love

177
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
and how you want to continue to care for

178
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,800
the people you love in your life.

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,280
So, in that way, it is very uplifting.

180
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,200
And the other uplifting thing is, of course,

181
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,760
it's now - happily, in America - it's now history.

182
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
That's right. We have marriage equality,

183
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
- which is a very, very big deal. 
- It's very recent history.

184
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,760
So, it's a nice thing to be able to look back on this.

185
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,840
Yeah, and to celebrate what they accomplished.

186
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,040
- And her partner is still alive? 
- Yes, Stacie Andree.

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
- Presumably, you got to meet her? 
- Oh, yeah. I spent a lot of time with her.

188
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,240
She still lives in the house that they lived in

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
and I also met her police partner and so, was able to meet her family

190
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,160
and really had access to everyone in her life.

191
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,920
Wow. Let's have a look at a clip from Freeheld.

192
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
This is you as Laurel and your girlfriend played by Ellen Page.

193
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,160
- The wonderful Ellen Page. 
- She is terrific.

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,120
And this is just after you've formalised your civil partnership.

195
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,160
- I got something for you.
- Yeah?

196
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,280
Looks like the beach.

197
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,080
Thanks.

198
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,160
- I got something for you, too. 
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,720
It's a card from the police union.

200
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Got your name on it.

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,040
It says we're family.

202
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,320
So, if you're stopped while you're driving -

203
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,600
and let's face it, you do drive fast -

204
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,640
just give this to the officer, you won't get a ticket.

205
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
"Family".

206
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,000
I guess that makes it official, huh?

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,640
Official, baby.

208
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,800
APPLAUSE Aw...

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,360
APPLAUSE

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,880
And Ellen Page there, she's amazing,

211
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,240
- and the film was very personal to her, I guess.
- Yeah, absolutely.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,200
Because before filming, she came out.

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,640
- She came out, yeah...
- Which is commitment, can I just say?

214
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
That's commitment, Julianne Moore, you're slacking.

215
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,600
LAUGHTER

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
- Pretending to be a lesbian. 
- I know, I know.

217
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
What is amazing was her first role as an out gay woman, you know,

218
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,560
playing a gay character, so it was really meaningful to her.

219
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,400
I bet it was. But wasn't it that she

220
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
thought you were going to be Miss Method and serious?

221
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,920
Yeah, she thought I was really methody. I'm not.

222
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,400
- Are you really not? 
- No, I'm just pretending.

223
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah, it's all pretending.

224
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,960
So do real methody people then get annoyed with you, because...?

225
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,440
Sometimes they do because of how much I talk.

226
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,360
Because I like to talk between takes about what I had for lunch

227
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
and what I'm going to do this weekend and these shoes that

228
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,280
I bought and, "Do you like the shoes that I bought?

229
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,440
"Should I take the shoes back? What do you think?

230
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,800
"Do you want to have lunch or should we have lunch later?

231
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,960
"Do you want a snack?" All the way up to action.

232
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,080
And every once in a while, someone will say, like, "Please be quiet!

233
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,600
- "For one minute!" 
- And don't you sing a lot?

234
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes. Yeah. I do.

235
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,000
It does sound quite annoying.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
LAUGHTER

237
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,960
- It is, it is.
- And what sort of songs do you sing?
- Like...

238
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,280
# Peanut butter jelly time Peanut butter jelly time

239
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
# Peanut butter jelly time... #

240
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,160
It's getting more annoying.

241
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,240
What's the weird thing at home that your kids don't believe you

242
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,800
when you laugh?

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, my daughter says I have a fake laugh.

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
I think I'm just trying to be...

245
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,200
You know when your kids say something,

246
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
you're like, "Oh, honey, yeah..."

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
And it's like, "That's not funny."

248
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,280
If I was a kid, I'd be going, "No, this isn't working."

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,720
That's not funny, that's completely fake, Mom. "No, I laugh like that."

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

251
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
Now, forgive me, because of course, Ant and Dec,

252
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
we forget, you are actors.

253
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,520
- We started as actors.
- I know, you did. Byker Grove.

254
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm not sure if Rebel or Julianne are familiar with Byker Grove.

255
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,640
It sounds very dramatic.

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,320
- Oh, it was.
- Some very hard-hitting storylines in Byker Grove.

257
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,840
LAUGHTER

258
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,720
I thought you were a girl in that one.

259
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,120
LAUGHTER

260
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
Then I realised it was leaves, yeah.

261
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,280
This is a very rare picture because this is Dec and Ant.

262
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,840
- Oh, yeah, the wrong way round. 
- You're the wrong way round.

263
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,520
Are you always in the same position?

264
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,240
We try, so people can remember which one's which, but it fails.

265
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,120
It doesn't work.

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,560
- Doesn't work.
- That's Dec and Ant or Duncan and PJ.

267
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,760
You were PJ and Duncan. Now, in the show, which one of you went blind?

268
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,840
Me, my character. PJ went blind. He was shot in the eyes.

269
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,480
Shot in the eyes!

270
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
At paintballing.

271
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,240
That's funny to you.

272
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,440
Shot in the head and went blind.

273
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,160
LAUGHTER

274
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
Shot in the eyes.

275
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,680
It was, er, it was a freak paintballing accident where PJ was

276
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,560
in the middle of a love triangle

277
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,840
and the two girls he was kind of messing around with

278
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,080
shot at the same time, and both paintballs hit him in the eyes.

279
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,240
That'll teach 'em. That'll teach 'em.

280
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,880
No shame in soap opera acting

281
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,120
because Julianne Moore, Oscar winner - I think I mentioned it earlier -

282
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,560
- you... That was your first job. 
- Yeah, As The World Turns

283
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,280
- it was called, mm-hm.
- How many years were you in that?
- Three.

284
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,000
It was my first big job. There's my family, my soap family.

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,960
Me and my mom and Dad and my grandparents and my brother

286
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,440
and my little brother and my sister-in-law.

287
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,360
- And for three years, like, a LOT of things happened to you.
- Sure, sure.

288
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,880
I was kidnapped. I didn't go blind. I did have amnesia. I did...

289
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,520
It turned out that my boyfriend was a killer, and he also slept with my

290
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,200
half-sister slash cousin cos it was dark and he couldn't tell us apart.

291
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,040
LAUGHTER

292
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,600
Could happen to anyone.

293
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,960
I was like, "Oh! You couldn't tell us apart! Oh, OK."

294
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,440
Did you forgive him?

295
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Yeah, of course, yeah, but then he turned out to be a killer

296
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,720
so it was a mess.

297
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,240
Oh, bad news bears.

298
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,440
Rebel, lots of actors who make it big in Hollywood have come

299
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,320
through the Australian soaps.

300
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah, the soaps like Home And Away, Neighbours. Not me.

301
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,800
- My very first...
- Did you audition for them or anything?

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,680
I didn't even get a chance to audition.

303
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,720
My very first agent meeting, I got rejected cos they, like,

304
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
looked me up and down and said,

305
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,960
"Yeah, you're not ever going to be on Home And Away.

306
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,840
- "So we're not going to take you." 
- Is that the only job in Australia?

307
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
One of them, yeah.

308
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,080
You tweeted this picture recently of yourself when you were starting out.

309
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,640
Is this, like, a head shot you would use for auditions?

310
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,760
- This is my first acting head shot. 
- Aw!

311
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,520
- There are a lot of questions...
- OK.

312
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,440
LAUGHTER

313
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,480
OK, why am I holding a softball mitt and a softball?

314
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,680
Just in case you didn't get that I was sporty.

315
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,600
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- You can play athletes, is that what you were saying?

316
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, I guess.

317
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
And then I'm wearing, like, the world's finest gold chain.

318
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
- Cos you're feminine as well.
- Yeah.

319
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,160
And an oversized T-shirt. I've just let my hair go feral.

320
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
LAUGHTER

321
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,320
Obviously had not met up with a professional stylist

322
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
at that point in my career.

323
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,080
And then I just liked the random graffiti cos

324
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,680
I did come from kind of the ghetto area of Sydney, so...

325
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,800
Most people just have, like, a plain background.

326
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,280
- Urban.
- Yeah, she's a rebel.

327
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,880
Like, yeah,

328
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,960
but no wonder nobody thought I would be a professional actress

329
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,840
with that headshot. Like, you can't stage something like that.

330
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,000
You look like you were in a great mood

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,400
and then you saw something truly awful.

332
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,160
Just like...

333
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,920
- Yeah, that. There you go. That's it.
- Yeah.

334
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,680
Now, Ant and Dec, when you decided to kind of move away from PJ

335
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,480
and Duncan and become Ant and Dec, rebrand yourselves as Ant and Dec,

336
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,760
you went through a sort of makeover, didn't you?

337
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
A kind of extreme makeover.

338
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes, yeah we did.

339
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,480
It wasn't our idea but we...

340
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah, we wanted to ditch the names PJ and Duncan and become Ant and Dec,

341
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
our real names, so I think it was Smash Hits magazine said,

342
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,000
"Well, you should do an image makeover. Why don't you do that?"

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
- So...
- Take That had done one and it worked really well.

344
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,880
We thought, "Yeah. Let's do it. Take That have done it."

345
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
So Ant said, "I'll shave me head."

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm like, "Oh, right. OK.

347
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,600
"Ooh, I don't really want to do that, that looks silly, that.

348
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
"I'll dye me hair."

349
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,080
So the idea was to dye my hair blonder, but it just went ginger.

350
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,760
- Nothing wrong with that, of course. 
- I was going to say...

351
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,720
- What I mean was it wasn't quite the look we were going for.
- Right.

352
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,400
This is the cover of Smash Hits.

353
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,960
There you go.

354
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,240
LAUGHTER

355
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah, it's not... It's vibrant yellow.

356
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
What I would say is, though, that happened,

357
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,480
and you obviously saw that in vibrant colour on a newsstand.

358
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,320
You then did a shoot for a gay magazine, Attitude,

359
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,000
and you thought, "We can tone this down and sex it up."

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,240
LAUGHTER

361
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,720
- It's what they say down the bottom there.
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,680
"Ant and Dec, Cocks of the north."

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,920
LAUGHTER

364
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,000
It looks like you've just put soil in your hair.

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,920
A bit of potting clay.

366
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,000
- That's pretty much what I did. 
- And then there's a brilliant picture inside.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
- This is brilliant.
- Oh, God.

368
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
- No, don't worry, Ant. You're safe. 
- Oh, good.

369
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,520
This is Dec and I don't know what the instruction was, what the

370
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,760
photographer said to Dec, but he must have said,

371
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,920
"Well, you're in a gay magazine.

372
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,160
"Do something that will really appeal to the gay readership."

373
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,040
I don't want to see this!

374
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,600
LAUGHTER

375
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,960
You've just stuck your hand down your pants!

376
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,800
You look like you're just itching your hole.

377
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,520
It was like... "The boys are going to love this!"

378
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,040
Come over here, boys, I've got an itchy arse.

379
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Oh, God.

380
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Oh, dear. Different times.

381
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,040
- Different times.
- Is that your copy, by the way?
- Yes, it is.

382
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,320
I've had it since.

383
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,520
There's a lot of stuff out there.

384
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,320
If you dig deep enough, there's a lot of bad photos of us.

385
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,760
But, hey, listen. Ant and Dec, back where they belong,

386
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,840
Saturday Night Takeaway is back on ITV on the 20th of February

387
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,720
and when people come on and say, "Oh, yeah, it's bigger and better."

388
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,320
But it really is. Like, you've got this extraordinary live finale.

389
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah, from a cruise ship.

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,400
- Oh, my God.
- Where will it be? 
- I know! Barcelona.

391
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,480
It's a cruise round the Med, cos every year we give tickets away

392
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,320
and normally the winners fly off live on the final

393
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,080
show of the series, but this year, we're doing the entire...

394
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,920
We're giving tickets away to a cruise round the Mediterranean

395
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,360
and we're doing the entire show live from a cruise ship,

396
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,200
and it's harboured in Barcelona.

397
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,680
Hopefully, there's not an E. coli outbreak.

398
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,880
- Norovirus could bring us down. 
- It'd be an explosive show.

399
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,440
LAUGHTER

400
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,440
That's one of the things. We're not quite sure how it's going to go.

401
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
- I mean, that's the idea.
- And also the link could drop out.

402
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Then you don't have to do it.

403
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,640
Cut a wire.

404
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,680
Not my fault! You were there.

405
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah, we've got no idea and it's quite exciting.

406
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,640
It's quite scary, but that's good, I think.

407
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,120
But you've got lots of the same things coming back.

408
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,600
All the favourites. Little Ant and Dec are back.

409
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,080
Little Ant and Dec Under Cover are back.

410
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,800
And also we've got a new item called "Who Shot Simon Cowell?"

411
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,080
And it's...

412
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,840
It's a weekly drama.

413
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,120
It's like a weekly four-minute drama with cliff-hangers.

414
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,800
- Because you forget we're actually actors.
- Of course!

415
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,360
And it was devised by Chris Chibnall, who wrote Broadchurch.

416
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,000
Wow!

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,680
We asked him on the off-chance - he went, "Yeah." We went, "What?"

418
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
I tell you what, to save you

419
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,360
explaining any more, we've got a clip.

420
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,280
This is the beginning of the ongoing drama of "Who Shot Simon Cowell?"

421
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,400
- I think the birthday boy's about to arrive. Come on, everybody.
- Come on.

422
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,560
CHEERING

423
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,520
# Happy birthday to you

424
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,640
# Happy birthday to you... #

425
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,280
That is so obvious. Second song?

426
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,600
What?

427
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
BULB EXPLODES

428
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
HE GROANS

429
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,920
Someone shot Simon Cowell!

430
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,480
We know, dear. We all saw it.

431
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,600
APPLAUSE

432
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
I love that Christopher Biggins has found a suit the same

433
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,400
colour as his skin.

434
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
LAUGHTER

435
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,200
That can't have been easy. In the shop going, "Is it...?"

436
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,520
Why is that other girl exposing her bush?

437
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,240
LAUGHTER

438
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,200
That's Sinitta, it's a long story.

439
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
I was going to say, trying to

440
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,160
explain Sinitta, it's very, very hard.

441
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,840
But, yeah, there's lots of people

442
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,800
who have a motive to shoot Simon Cowell.

443
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,520
Let's be honest. So that's it over the course of the series.

444
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,880
And I must mention, Wednesday the 24th,

445
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
back hosting the Brits for the third time.

446
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
- Yes.
- Last year, a big success.

447
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,760
But... Well, the thing that everyone remembers about last year's Brits,

448
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,560
- you missed.
- Yeah, we kind of missed it.
- Yeah, Madonna falling...

449
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,320
Did you see this back in the States?

450
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,760
She was wearing a cape, and they pulled the cape

451
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,120
and it was tied too tight and it pulled her off the stage.

452
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
It was amazing.

453
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,560
No, I was in the audience. It was 20,000 people going...

454
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,200
We'd done our last link.

455
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,640
Our last thing was link into Madonna, we'd hit, you know,

456
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
we'd landed the plane, we were out of there.

457
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,800
And you know what it's like, as soon as you go, "Are you coming back?

458
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,080
"You're not coming back to me? Great." Earpiece out.

459
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
Microphone off. Champagne.

460
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,480
We clinked and went, "Well, that went well. That went smoothly."

461
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
And then there was just this gasp in the room

462
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,760
and we turned around and she was on her back.

463
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
We couldn't quite work out if it was part of the routine.

464
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,680
We weren't sure. I had champagne in my hand.

465
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,920
I wasn't too bothered, if I'm honest with you.

466
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,320
Went back to the dressing room, watched the news at ten,

467
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,360
and she'd fallen.

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
It was the news headline, wasn't it?

469
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,080
We got back to the room just in time for the news to start.

470
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
It was like, "Madonna has fallen at the Brits."

471
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
"Ooh, is that what happened?"

472
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,040
And Rebel Wilson, of course, you've hosted. You hosted the MTV...

473
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Yeah, I tried to host and, yeah, it's really nerve-racking.

474
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,360
- Do you guys get nervous?
- Yeah.

475
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Yeah, I get, like, really nervous, especially when it's live.

476
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,080
And I think at MTV I did, like, a nip slip.

477
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,640
We've got some of your outfits. You did some very good outfits.

478
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,480
I call that one Iron Mangina.

479
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,920
Custom-made for the event.

480
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,600
- I think we've got your, your... 
- Yeah, that's the double nip slip.

481
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,200
LAUGHTER

482
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,400
I just had to, like, up the ante on the nip slip situation.

483
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,000
That's your Oscar loser face, right there.

484
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,240
- That got cut from the non-live telecasts.
- Really?

485
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, cos it really is live when you're doing those things,

486
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
but then when they replay it they cut out all the super rude bits.

487
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,840
And even a fake nipple would be too...?

488
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,280
Yeah, people thought it was real.

489
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm a screw-up from Australia.

490
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Weird stuff might have...

491
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,280
She could have been exposed to asbestos or something.

492
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,480
She's Australian. It could be a spider bite.

493
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,280
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is Valentine's weekend,

494
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,840
and Rebel Wilson brings us the perfect film in How To Be Single.

495
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,200
It previews on the 14th and opens everywhere on the 19th,

496
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,320
so Rebel, what's it about? Who are you in this film?

497
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,120
I play Robin, she's, like, a functioning alcoholic.

498
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,520
So typecast again.

499
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,720
I'm one of the four main girls and... Oh, yeah. Getting smashed.

500
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,840
Whilst filming the scenes.

501
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,640
It was a really fun shoot.

502
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,080
I can't remember a lot.

503
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,360
But the movie basically follows myself,

504
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,800
Dakota Johnson, Leslie Mann, Alison Brie,

505
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,760
who are four single women just living it up in New York City

506
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
and they have very different

507
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,680
ways of dealing with the fact that they're single.

508
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,560
And you do get to kiss a lot of people in this movie.

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,320
- Yeah.
- And is it true you got to hand pick them?

510
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,400
Oh, gee. OK, so one of the days,

511
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
we were filming a big nightclub sequence, where the director just

512
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,760
wanted me to randomly pash a lot of the guys on the dance floor,

513
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,040
so I got to choose which ones I wanted.

514
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,640
And it's really embarrassing,

515
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,440
because the assistant director yells out, "OK,

516
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,120
"if anybody does not want to kiss Rebel Wilson, stand over there."

517
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh, no!

518
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,720
Only, like, three wankers went over there.

519
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,760
LAUGHTER

520
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,280
And then the rest, they were all lined up,

521
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,200
and then I had to parade down and, like, choose.

522
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,880
It was very embarrassing, and I chose, you know, a selection.

523
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,960
Different ethnicities, you know.

524
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,880
And then one African American gentlemen, who I chose, came up to

525
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,400
me at the end of the day, and said,

526
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,600
"I just want you to know that you've really changed my life."

527
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,920
And I was like...

528
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,880
I mean, at first I was a bit freaked out, because I was like,

529
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,240
"Were you gay and then now I've turned you?"

530
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,720
LAUGHTER

531
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,560
Or, you know, "Did you have some

532
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,080
"disease and you've passed it on to me?

533
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,600
"Now I'm going to sue you and your life's really going to be changed."

534
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
No, but really, he was just

535
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,400
so honoured out of the sea of men to have been selected.

536
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,560
- Aw.
- By me and it was like, "I feel like I've done good today."

537
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,680
LAUGHTER

538
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,480
And, of course, you mentioned, one of your co-stars,

539
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,240
Dakota Johnson, and was this right after Fifty Shades of Grey?

540
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Yeah, she'd just done Fifty Shades of Grey

541
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
and I had the day I started filming this movie,

542
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Pitch Perfect 2 came out and we're really on the streets of New York

543
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,640
City, so we had, like,

544
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,880
teenage girls and late middle-aged perverts

545
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,040
coming up to us.

546
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,320
Could you see them coming?

547
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,360
- Could you kind of go, "Dakota, one of yours."
- Yeah, yeah.

548
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,920
The guy holding the flower.

549
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,320
"Dakotes, that's for you."

550
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,360
- And masking tape.
- Yeah.

551
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,360
Our clip is your character giving

552
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,400
Dakota some tips on how to text boys.

553
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,320
If Tom texts you, which he won't cos it's still daylight,

554
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
- wait four hours to respond. 
- I was not even thinking about Tom.

555
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Anything sooner implies that you're needy and really co-dependent

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,080
and incapable of a simple hook-up, which is all he's good for.

557
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,200
I think that I could be actually, like, a good...

558
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,640
And when you respond, do not respond in full sentences,

559
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,760
and if you use an emoji, I will tit punch you.

560
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,200
- Fine.
- Fine.

561
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,160
PHONE BUZZES

562
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,880
- No, no! Oh, no!
- You can have this back at the end of the day.

563
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,160
An emoji!

564
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,240
LAUGHTER

565
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,000
APPLAUSE

566
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,160
Fifty Shades of Grey all over again!

567
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,800
That girl cannot catch a break.

568
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,520
And I really did connect with her tit.

569
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
I didn't mean to.

570
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
You know, cos you do it about five or six times,

571
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,520
and five out of the six I didn't connect.

572
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,400
One out of the six it was just like right on the nipple.

573
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Yeah.

574
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,920
Now, the film has lots of kind of advice on dating

575
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,000
and how to navigate dating and some of the rules I was aware of.

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,800
There were some I...

577
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,040
So I was not aware of this. Explain dick sand.

578
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,440
OK. Dick sand is where a girl meets a guy and she kind of

579
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,840
- loses herself cos she falls into his dick sand.
- Oh, yeah.

580
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,920
What?

581
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,360
- See, Julianne knows. 
- It's like quicksand.

582
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,360
- Exactly, but it's dick sand. 
- With dicks.
- You got it.

583
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,520
LAUGHTER

584
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
You said that out loud.

585
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,200
You weren't just thinking that. You said it.

586
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,360
"Oh, it's like quicksand, but with a... Oh..."

587
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,760
- Clever!
- You girls.

588
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,720
No, but you see it happen with girls all the time.

589
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,080
They, like, just become part of the relationship and lose who they

590
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,120
are and that's really what happens to Dakota's character in the film.

591
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,400
But doesn't that happen to boys as well?

592
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,360
- Don't boys get lost in their girlfriends?
- In the vadge pond.

593
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,320
LAUGHTER

594
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,640
Well, I can tell you,

595
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,680
we spent hours trying to think what they'd call that.

596
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,520
We got men get lose in the labia-rinth.

597
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh, yeah!

598
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,240
That's good. Yeah. I say "we", but I didn't come up with it.

599
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,400
But I did think, "Ooh, that's very good. I'll have it."

600
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,840
"I'll say that on the show and appear clever."

601
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,120
- And Ant and Dec, obviously, both married now.
- Yeah.

602
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,160
- You just got married last year, wasn't it?
- Last year, August, yeah.

603
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,360
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. 
- And now...

604
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
- Ant?
- Yep?
- You are married,

605
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,400
but I do think,

606
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,280
- how the hell does your wife put up with you?
- I think this! Yeah!

607
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,880
Like, "..and happily married." Why?

608
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,200
Tell them, tell them. You know the story. This is so mean.

609
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,720
- This is such a mean prank. 
- Yeah, we were a lot younger.

610
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,880
So, I've been with my wife...we've been married ten years this year.

611
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,560
We've been together about 20 years.

612
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,480
When we first started getting together,

613
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,280
we shared a flat in London, in Fulham.

614
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,600
And I thought it would be hilarious one night,

615
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
we'd been out for a drink or something,

616
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,280
she was in the flat on her own and I said, "Wouldn't it be funny

617
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,800
"if you pretended to be me and get

618
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,280
"into bed with her and then see what the reaction is."

619
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,160
- That's like what happened on my soap opera.
- Yes, yes!

620
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,720
- It is true.
- So I was like, "Well, I'm game."

621
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,040
LAUGHTER

622
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,240
- Sounds funny to me! 
- "How long are you going to be?"

623
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,520
No, so he was like, "What would you normally say?"

624
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,440
I said, "Hiya, pet",

625
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,120
or "hi, babe", and he'd practise it with a deep voice.

626
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,600
I said, "A bit deeper than that."

627
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,800
I said, "I'm quite clumsy around the bedroom,

628
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,920
"so just make sure you bang into some things."

629
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,400
And then, when he got into bed, I'd leave it a minute or two,

630
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,320
then open the door, put the light on and go,

631
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,520
"what the bloody hell's going on here?"

632
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,040
Absolutely hated the guy. Didn't find it funny at all.

633
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,280
Still hasn't forgive us. So, yeah, I do wonder how she puts up with me.

634
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,400
- There's a few of them, actually.
- I just love the fact that you thought

635
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,840
- that was going to be funny in
- any way. I know!

636
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,960
It's true. It's true.

637
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,240
I put a wig in the bed once and then pillows and pretended it was me,

638
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,720
and jumped out the window, went along the balcony and then watched

639
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,000
her go to bed, put her nightie on,

640
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
get in the bed, go to cuddle and...

641
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
"OH, MY..."

642
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,680
That is better. Yeah, yeah.

643
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,440
I've learned now, I don't do that kind of stuff. As much.

644
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,640
Have you got big Valentine's weekend plans?

645
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,440
- We're working on Valentine's Day. 
- Handy!

646
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,200
LAUGHTER

647
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,440
Worryingly, my wife is actually our manager, so she controls the diary,

648
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,920
so she obviously doesn't want to go out with me on Valentine's Day.

649
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,240
She's put me to work!

650
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,360
And Julianne, what are you doing?

651
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,920
The BAFTAs. The BAFTAs are always on Valentine's Day.

652
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,920
- Are they always?
- What does that mean? Yeah, they're always

653
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,360
- on Valentine's Day.
- Oh!
- Yeah, so I'll be there.
- Plans?

654
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,480
- I'll be at the BAFTAs as well. 
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

655
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,800
Just looking for love.

656
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,480
LAUGHTER

657
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,200
Idris Elba.

658
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,520
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

659
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,840
OK!

660
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,640
It's time for music.

661
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,600
Now, this group are the hottest girl band in the world right now.

662
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,240
They've already sold over 12 million records

663
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,080
and now have two BRIT Award nominations.

664
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,760
Here performing Secret Love Song with Jason Derulo,

665
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,400
please welcome the Little Mix!

666
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

667
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,080
# When you hold me in the street

668
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,080
# And you kiss me on the dance floor

669
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,880
# I wish that it could be like that

670
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,320
# Why can't it be like that?

671
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,320
# Cos I'm yours

672
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,600
# We keep behind closed doors

673
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,680
# Every time I see you I die a little more

674
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,040
# Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls

675
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,920
# It'll never be enough

676
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,760
# But we know this

677
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,960
# We got a love that is hopeless

678
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,520
# Why can't you hold me in the street?

679
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,640
# Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

680
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,360
# I wish that it could be like that

681
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
# Why can't we be like that?

682
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,640
# Cos I'm yours... #

683
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,880
Please welcome to the stage, Jason Derulo!

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

685
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,640
# When you're with him do you call his name?

686
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,200
# Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?

687
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,160
# Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?

688
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,000
# Or would you play it safe and stay?

689
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,680
# Girl you know this

690
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,560

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
# Why can't we be like that?

695
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
# Cos I'm yours

696
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,800
# And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby

697
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,880
# I don't wanna hide us away

698
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
# Tell the world about the love we making

699
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
# I'm living for that day

700
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
# Someday

701
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,560
# Can I hold you in the street?

702
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,040
# Can I kiss you on the dance floor?

703
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,120
# I wish that we could be like that

704
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,400

706
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,280
# I'm yours

707
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,280
# Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?

708
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,120
# Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

709
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,120

# Why can't I say that I'm in love?

713
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,840

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,640

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

720
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,360
Little Mix, everyone! Great job! And Mr Derulo!

721
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,600
And Little Mix, come up and see us, do.

722
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,280
Come and see us! There we go!

723
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,520
Up, up, there you go. Welcome to the show.

724
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,960
Hello, darling. Welcome. And welcome. And welcome.

725
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,160
Little Mix!

726
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,200
Great job.

727
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

728
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,160
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

729
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,120
Oh, It's like a reception line at a wedding.

730
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,960
Yes, shove up, shove up.

731
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,440
Two and two. There you go, lovely, lovely.

732
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,480
Thank you so much for coming, and what a nice surprise, Jason Derulo.

733
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,800
CHEERING

734
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,880
- That was very... 
- There's a spot for Jason here...

735
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,160
LAUGHTER

736
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,520
And of course that single is from the album, Get Weird,

737
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,720
which is out now. You know what?

738
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,680
Here is a thing, people don't make enough fuss of Little Mix.

739
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,240
ALL: Aaaw!

740
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,720
No, they don't.

741
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,600
Because that album, it outsold One Direction last year.

742
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,640
I mean, Little Mix are a big deal.

743
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

744
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,800
Now, album, very, very good, but, and I will spare your blushes,

745
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,120
but ladies, this album, it is a little bit raunchy.

746
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,560
A little bit. Yes, we got a bit older with the lyrics.

747
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
- But some we had to change cos the label wasn't too happy.
- Yes.

748
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,680
- For instance, A-D-I-D-A-S is not a song about sportswear.
- No.

749
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,960
- Not quite.
- What is it about?
- Sex. 
- There, she said it!

750
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,560
Out of her young mouth, came that disgusting word(!)

751
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,480
- "All I do..."
- "All day I dream about ... with you."

752
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,640
- Oh, do you? Well, I'd no idea!
- With him?

753
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,080
I think you're barking up the wrong tree there.

754
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,520
Yeah! It may remain a dream!

755
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,480
APPLAUSE

756
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,160
We should say, by the way, tour, starting 13th March in Cardiff,

757
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,280
and then it culminates in, who knew?

758
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,600
Sheffield Arena. Sheffield has an arena.

759
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,640
And you are going to be in it. On 23 April.

760
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,320
- Yes.
- And we should just say, not just nominated for two Brit awards,

761
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,560
good luck with them,

762
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,320
but you have joined an amazing list of acts on the night.

763
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,760
Yes, we are absolutely crapping ourselves.

764
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,040
- Well that's good to know.
- You guys are doing it as well, aren't you?

765
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,080
I know, it is scary. Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Adele, it is huge for us.

766
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,600
Yes, it is great. It's going to be a good night.

767
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
What are you doing, what are you doing?

768
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,560
We can't actually say what song we are doing.

769
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,680
- I know!
- I'll tell you! 
- I'll tell you later, yeah.

770
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,600
- I mean, presumably you are going all bells and whistles?
- Literally.

771
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,640
- We've got kneepads, sticks... 
- Well!

772
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,400
You're really selling it, ladies(!)

773
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,320
You've really pushed the boat out there(!)

774
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,000
Kneepads, sticks, bells, and whistles. Well!

775
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
That's the end of the show right there. That is it.

776
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,120
Listen, good luck, thank you for coming,

777
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,680
and best of luck at the Brits, with the nominations.

778
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,280
Little Mix, everybody! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

779
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,560
Just before we go we do have time for a visitor to the big red chair.

780
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,640
- So let's see who is there. Hello?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

781
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,760
I just... LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

782
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,320
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

783
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,560
Just not in the mood! LAUGHTER

784
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,000
That could have been the best story in the world, but there was something,

785
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,680
it was all put together, something, in the way she spoke,

786
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,240
and I thought, this might not be a real person.

787
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,400
- If anyone is willing, we'll have one more. One more. Hello.
- Hello!

788
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,280
- Hi, what's your name?
- Amy.
- Amy, lovely. And what do you do, Amy?

789
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
I work in pharmaceuticals.

790
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,840
- It does make me laugh that you have blended into that chair.
- I know!

791
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,320
- It's quite well done. 
- Just a necklace and a head.

792
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,640
It is the opposite of Chris Biggins.

793
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,280
All right, Amy, off you go with your story.

794
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,360
OK, so it was just before Christmas,

795
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,480
my boyfriend and I went to Amsterdam,

796
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,200
and while we were in Amsterdam he said to me

797
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,520
that he had heard his friends say there was this really good bar

798
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,800
where you go and a girl would write you a postcard

799
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,760
using her downstairs area.

800
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,000
So he thought this would be really fun...

801
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,640
LAUGHTER Sorry, just before Christmas?

802
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,480
You could bring in all your cards, couldn't you? Save some time!

803
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,440
So I thought, why not?

804
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,960
So we went to this bar, and we walked in the door

805
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,760
and we had to pay to get in, obviously,

806
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
and unfortunately they did not take Amex,

807
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,480
which was his credit card, so I had to fork out 100 euros

808
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,080
to get into this place,

809
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,160
so we go upstairs, we meet all these lovely ladies,

810
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,360
and it turns out we have to give them even more money,

811
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,320
and then it transpires that we can't just get the postcard,

812
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,920
we have to buy a package of products.

813
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,080
So I didn't sign up for this, but Steve was like,

814
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,680
"I really, really want this postcard."

815
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,760
So I was like, OK, we'll do this.

816
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,920
LAUGHTER OK, I need to know this right now.

817
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,280
- Are you still with this man? 
- Yeah.
- OK!

818
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,240
So anyway, so we paid her some more money

819
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,520
and then what happens is, I just think Steve is going to do

820
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,880
all this stuff, but then the woman is like,

821
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,320
"No, you have to do that as well."

822
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,280
- So I ended up... 
- You had to write?

823
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,160
No, no, I didn't write the postcard.

824
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,840
LAUGHTER

825
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,760
If you can do that, you can walk!

826
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,200
- Here's a pen(!) 
- Has anybody got a sharpener?

827
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,560
No, I definitely didn't do that.

828
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
OK, so, Amy, you have to do something, yes?

829
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,200
She made me massage her boobs, and her bum,

830
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,320
yes, it was pretty traumatic for me.

831
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Have you got the address of this place?

832
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
I think she has got it written down somewhere.

833
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,560
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

834
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,600
Then Steve had to do the same, thankfully, but, yeah,

835
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,680
we did get our postcard, and it is now on our fridge at home.

836
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,720
- So there's our story.
- I think she deserves to walk.
- Yes.

837
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,560
Walk, walk, Amy, go on. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

838
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,600
Well, then, everyone.

839
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,560

Please say a huge thank you to my guests, Little Mix!
