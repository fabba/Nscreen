00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,720
On the other hand, Black Mass stars Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,040
It's monsters V mobsters! Let's start the show!

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,240
This programme contains some strong language

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,880
Oh, too kind! Too kind!

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
Too kind! Thank you very much.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,520
Thank you very much! Good evening and welcome! Lots of excitement tonight.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,280
Yes, in a minute, Johnny and Benedict will be here, ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,920
CHEERING Yes, they will!

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,120
Calm down. Calm down, Cumberbitches

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,440
and Depp - I don't know what Depp's are. Depprobates? I don't know.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,560
Later, I'll be joined by the stars of the new movie Victor Frankenstein -

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,920
James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe will be here,

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,840
ladies and gentlemen, yes, they will. CHEERING

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,720
James plays Dr Frankenstein

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,680
and Daniel is his assistant, Igor. You know Igor.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
Here's a picture of Daniel

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,440
with the instructions for building the monster.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,200
You know what it's like, they're never easy to follow, are they? No.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,800
LAUGHTER "Finished!"

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,880
That's all to come, plus music from the fabulous Corrs!

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,480
The Corrs are back! CHEERING

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,160
But, first, he's the Oscar-nominated star who's won legions of fans

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,920
from his roles in Star Trek, The Hobbit and The Imitation Game and,

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,080
of course, his tour de force as Sherlock Holmes.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Please welcome Benedict Cumberbatch!

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,960
Hello, sir. How nice to see you.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
Welcome. Thank you very much for doing this.

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,920
And one of our most brilliant and versatile actors, playing characters

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,160
from Edward Scissorhands to Willy Wonka and Captain Jack Sparrow,

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,640
currently getting the best reviews of his career in the new mobster biopic

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,960
Black Mass, it is Johnny Depp, everybody!

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Yes, it is!

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
Wow!

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, sir, lovely to see you. Sit down.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CONTINUES

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,440
You're both very welcome. Lovely to see you both.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,200
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. 
- I feel like we're so far apart.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,360
Snuggle, snuggle. There you go.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,720
That's adorable.

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,160
Ladies and gentlemen, before we do another thing,

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
we should congratulate you, Benedict Cumberbatch.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,360
- The last time you were here, since then, you've become a daddy.
- I have.

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,080
- CHEERING AND WHOOPING 
- Thank you very much.

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
And a husband as well.

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,960
- Of course, you got married. 
- Yes. I did both things.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,920
- And in the right order. Well done.
- Just.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,120
Was it a Cumber-boy or a Cumber-girl?

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
It is a Cumber-boy.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
LAUGHTER

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,160
- Lovely.
- A Cumberbatch boy. 
- He's aiming for a batch.

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,720
- He'll go for a batch.
- I might go for a batch of Cumbers.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
I'll just have a batch right now.

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Cheers.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,960
Cheers, sir, cheers. Yes, cheers.

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,680
It's like we're on a balcony looking at people in the streets. Well done.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,760
LAUGHTER

61
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,400
In New Orleans.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,880
Johnny, you've spent a lot of time in London.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Is this a kind of home from home? No.

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,280
You asked the question and then you said no.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
It's sort of a no-yes, really.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,160
I end up here a lot, working.

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,600
A lot of location stuff here.

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,520
- Well, you're very welcome. 
- Thank you very much.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,840
I was trying to get the, you know, the sir thing.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,360
Yes! Sir Johnny Depp.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,600
Have you met any royalty along the way?

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,760
Yeah, I did, yeah. Prince Charles and, um...

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,080
The other one.

74
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,880
LAUGHTER

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
That one.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Came to the premiere of Finding Neverland.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,240
- Oh, OK.
- Yeah. And I, sort of, shook his hand.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
He was, sort of, "Oh, rather."

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,720
I didn't understand a word he said.

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,360
And I don't think that he understood a word I said.

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,280
So it wasn't very meaningful, necessarily.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,200
And "that one..."

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,880
seemed nice, actually.

84
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,480
- She did.
- I think the knighthood's in the post.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,120
The weird thing is, when you search online for people who have taken

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
selfies and stuff with your good self, Johnny Depp,

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,800
it seems it's not that hard to look like Johnny Depp.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,840
- This is just...
- Wow. That's a bold claim.

89
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,640
No, no, wait. Here are some people out for the night.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,560
"Oh, my God! Just met Johnny Depp and fed him a hot dog."

91
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,600
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,920
- As long as she's happy. She's happy. 
- She's very, very happy.

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,680
Obviously, you're here to talk about Black Mass, which is terrific.

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
And the thing is, in Boston, when you were there,

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
it must have caused a sensation,

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,160
but then, double the chaos, because, Benedict Cumberbatch,

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,200
- wherever you go, you have very ardent fans. MUFFLED:
- I do.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
- He said, "I do." 
- I said I do.

99
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Via the medium of a gin and tonic, I said I do, yes.

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,840
And somebody saw Benedict on location in Boston.

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,680
We've got a picture of you on set that day.

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,880
And so, she saw Benedict

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,280
and immediately rushed home and went on to Reddit.

104
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,040
She goes, "I saw BostonBatch," cos that's your name in Boston.

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,000
- It's an adaptable surname.
- Yes. "I saw Boston Batch this morning.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,240
"Bury me in a Y-shaped coffin for I am deaded."

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,040
So, she writes, "Bitches, he is fine."

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,080
LAUGHTER

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,400
"He was wearing the blue hat, a dark blue polo shirt,

110
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,760
"the grey pants and white shoes.

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,680
"He's taller than I thought - I suspected he was about 5'11"

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
- "wannabe six-footer..." 
- How dare you!

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
"..and ripped."

114
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,280
LAUGHTER

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,320
"Like, really much more muscly than I was expecting.

116
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,360
"Those arms, dat ass..."

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,480
LAUGHTER AND CHEERING

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,280
"..and the arm veins were in full effect. Popping.

119
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,000
"There was not an ounce of fat on that man, it's all muscle,

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,360
"sinewy, wholesome goodness.

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,400
"And the hat looks better in real life, too."

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,320
- What was wrong with the hat? 
- The last paragraph is where

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,880
you just kind of think, "Whoa."

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,600
"I couldn't smell him.

125
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,160
"I really tried.

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,400
"He was so close that, had he been wearing cologne,

127
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,560
"I think I would've been able to tell.

128
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,640
"Just the lightest Cumbermusk in the Boston sunshine."

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,080
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Are you getting it, Johnny?

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Cumbermusk.

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,040
I must waft my musk in your general direction.

132
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,640
I gotta tell you, I can finally admit that I wrote that.

133
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,240
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

134
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,760
It's true.

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Driving me wild.

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,120
My popping veins in my arms...

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,760
We must talk about Black Mass. This movie...

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
CHEERING

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,000
..it's kind of an instant classic.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,040
It's had brilliant, brilliant reviews.

141
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,480
It's out now and it's the true story about mobster Whitey Bulger and,

142
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
Johnny, you play Whitey Bulger.

143
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,920
Were you aware... In this country, I'd never heard of Whitey Bulger.

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,680
- Is he famous in America? Did you know about him?
- He is.

145
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,240
There was a sort of fascination

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,840
with Mr Bulger.

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,640
He ran south Boston

148
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,440
for a number of years as this...

149
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,480
Well, gangster, you know.

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Meanwhile, his brother was state senator

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,360
and very high up in the political ranks.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,840
But, yeah, I just found him fascinating.

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,560
The fact that he was able to escape the Feds

154
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,240
and live on the run for 16 years.

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
When they found him,

156
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,520
he was in a tiny little apartment in Santa Monica.

157
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,640
The walls were filled with all kinds of weapons

158
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,960
and 800,000 in cash.

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,160
And he was living, you know, with his girlfriend, feeding cats.

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,080
Wow. Watching it, you know it's a true story, but it's sort of

161
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,320
- unbelievable...
- Yeah. 
- ..that it was allowed to go on.

162
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
If you pitched this as a movie script...

163
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Yeah, cos, actually, Whitey Bulger was in league with the FBI.

164
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,160
He was approached by the character that Joel Edgerton plays

165
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
to make a deal with the Feds

166
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,360
to give information about his enemies,

167
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,400
which were from northern Boston,

168
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,160
the Italians, the Cosa Nostra up there.

169
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,240
And they, you know, in a sense,

170
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,240
they gave Jimmy Bulger free rein

171
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,520
to do whatever he had to do.

172
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,400
When you see a picture of him, you don't immediately think,

173
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,560
"Oh, Johnny Depp, what great casting." But your transformation

174
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
- is extraordinary in the film. 
- That's kind, thank you.

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,800
That is Johnny Depp. That's not him, that's Johnny Depp.

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,880
So, Benedict...

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,560
I didn't meet Johnny Depp. I met Whitey Bulger.

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
We met on the set and they'd been going for a while -

179
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
I think almost a month or so.

180
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,160
You know, it was this extraordinary thing.

181
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,680
I didn't meet Johnny Depp, I met Whitey Bulger.

182
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,480
And I only met, physically, what Johnny looks like

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,560
almost a year later in England when he was doing something here

184
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,440
and I was in the same studio and I put my head around the corner

185
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,720
and went, "Hello." It set our friendship back about six notches.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,920
I was at the embarrassed, "Oh, my God, I'm meeting Johnny Depp," stage

187
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,720
rather than somebody who'd already just played his brother.

188
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,400
So, for you, it's a challenging thing to play a person from Boston,

189
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,880
but you're playing someone who's

190
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
a well-known, well-liked local figure.

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
- That's a lot of pressure. 
- It is a bit, it is a bit.

192
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,520
On the first day, I was leading this big St Patrick's Day parade,

193
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,760
which he did as President of the State Senate

194
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
and there he is doing it.

195
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
And the guy behind me was leading a pipe band.

196
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,560
It was the most amazing day of filming, actually.

197
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,080
It was just this incredible array of people doing very authentic work

198
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,920
from that period in recreating this parade.

199
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
And this guy doing the pipes behind me said, "Who are you playing?"

200
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,920
I went, "Billy Bulger." "You look nothing like him."

201
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll get back on the plane, then.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,960
In all honesty, I had a couple of prosthetics put on my cheeks to try

203
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,840
and get me a little bit rounder face, cos of my weird long face.

204
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,920
And I was, actually - God bless that woman/Johnny Depp for noticing that

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,080
I was quite muscly at the time, because I'd been working out a lot,

206
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,600
cos I'm taller than him,

207
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,960
- to try and look broader so I could try and play squatter.
- Oh!

208
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,640
LAUGHTER

209
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
That came with a lot of work. I didn't wake up looking like that.

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,520
- Does that not make you feel better, though?
- Ohh...

211
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Crushed her again.

212
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,320
THEY LAUGH

213
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,640
So, yeah, it was a lot of fun.

214
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,120
It's unbelievable. You're both great in it.

215
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,000
This is a clip from the movie and this is the two of you

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,040
- spending some quality family time. 
- Mm.

217
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,200
Gin.

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,640
Come on. Not again.

219
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,440
You're not paying attention.

220
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Can't you see I'm after hearts and you just keep feeding me hearts.

221
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm getting creamed over here.

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,160
Didn't you learn nothing in prison?

223
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,400
All those hours and no-one taught you how to play gin.

224
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,640
Well, they didn't teach me how to cheat against my mom.

225
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,240
Look, here's my cards, count 'em.

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,800
Hey, Ma, did you hear old Mother Burke died over on Baker Street?

227
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
- No-one found her for a couple of weeks.
- That's right.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,120
When they broke down the door,

229
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,160
the cats had devoured the best part of her.

230
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,640
That's beautiful, Ma. Who's hungry?

231
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm out. I got creamed. I'm going to take a nap. Thanks for cheating, Ma.

232
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
See you later.

233
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

234
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Watching the movie, it happens so fast, you forget it's Johnny Depp.

235
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,280
- It's weird.
- I hope so. That's the...

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,600
That's the goal, you know.

237
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,760
And, you know, obviously you go through creating characters,

238
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,040
but to come up with something as quirky as Captain Jack...

239
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
WHOOPING Yes.

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,120
APPLAUSE

241
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,960
But then, to have him be so loved...

242
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,960
and we've seen those pictures of you when you visit hospitals and schools

243
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,120
and that must be an amazing gift to be able to give those people.

244
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,800
I mean, for me, it's the gift. They're giving me the gift,

245
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,560
because to go into a place...

246
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
where, you know, I mean...

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,880
I've spent time in Great Ormond Street,

248
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
where I was the parent,

249
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,000
when my daughter was ill, and it was...

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,720
I mean, I've known darkness in my life,

251
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,480
but that was the darkest period ever.

252
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,400
It was when I was doing Sweeney and...

253
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,720
I'd always done these visits, but after that, the visits became

254
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
more and more important,

255
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,520
because the kids, bless them,

256
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,120
they're so strong, they're so courageous...

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,720
but the parents are the ones who are slowly dying,

258
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,480
and to be able to bring a smile or a giggle to these people...

259
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,560
it means everything in the world to me, you know. Far more than...

260
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,240
APPLAUSE

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
And, obviously, another great creation,

262
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,000
Benedict's Sherlock Holmes, ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

264
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,040
On Mastermind there. 1900s.

265
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
I have to ask...I know you can't tell me anything,

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,400
- so Christmas, it's back.
- Yes.
- Is it just one episode at Christmas?

267
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,560
- You can tell me that. 
- Yes.

268
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,440
Sorry, that was bad. Yes, it's just a one-off Christmas special.

269
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
- Is that the one where...?
- I rang up the other day and, literally, like,

270
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,640
"No, I can't talk about that, can't talk about that, can't really

271
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,280
"talk about that. Whatever can I talk about on this sofa?"

272
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,720
No, it's great, it's fantastic and I haven't seen it,

273
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
so I can't even say that, really.

274
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,000
But is this the one? Cos we've seen some stills -

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,840
- this is the one set in... 
- Old Victorian London, yeah,

276
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,040
the original Conan Doyle setting.

277
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,120
- Fog and all. 
- And it's one episode?

278
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,400
You'll just have to wait and see.

279
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,880
All right, I did ask!

280
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,560
I can't take it, please!

281
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,040
I beg you!

282
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,480
Now, along with great fame comes great fandom

283
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,880
and along with great fandom come weirdos.

284
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,400
LAUGHTER

285
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
We have discussed this on the show before -

286
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,480
I don't know, are you aware of this, Johnny Depp?

287
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,440
That when Benedict became famous,

288
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,000
one of the first things that happened was his fans - this is so random -

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,440
his fans decided that he looked very like an otter. Are you aware of this?

290
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
I'm sorry?

291
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,800
LAUGHTER

292
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,360
You would think, We've shown these before, these are classics.

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,680
- An otter?
- Otter, you know, a creature.
- Him, an otter?
- Yeah.

294
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,360
- He looks like an otter.
- I can only imagine what mine would be!

295
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,600
We may find out. Here is a classic otter.

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,680
And you think...it does look...

297
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,680
LAUGHTER

298
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,440
Here is a more expressive otter.

299
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
And, see?

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,400
LAUGHTER

301
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,840
And this next one you would think, "How can he look like this?"

302
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,360
And here you go, there he is.

303
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,960
- Now... 
- May I say one thing?
- Yes.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,640
Someone has a lot of time on their hands.

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,320
You know what's annoying, though? They don't have enough time

306
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,680
on their hands, because there aren't really any more out there.

307
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,520
- So, would you be up for matching some pictures of otters?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,040
I'll return the favour, yes.

309
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,640
AMERICAN ACCENTS: And then, it'll go viral and it'll be great.

310
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,800
- It'll be super.
- It'll be amazing. 
- People will like viral pictures

311
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,720
of me and an otter and will go and see a film about a violent gangster,

312
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,160
- yay! 
- You know how this works!

313
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm sort of scared of otters.

314
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,320
You won't be after... Well, actually, this first otter,

315
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,480
I'm afraid, it's the dark side of the otter kingdom.

316
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,840
This is angry otter.

317
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,480
LAUGHTER

318
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,600
It makes you love otters. Can you do that? Can you try it?

319
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
It's good!

320
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Excellent.

321
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,760
- That's really good. 
- Was it all right?

322
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,920
OK, this next one is also a slightly aggressive otter.

323
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,360
It's a bit fisty, it's a bit like, "Why I outta...!"

324
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,200
Other way.

325
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,920
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

326
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,120
These are good, these are good.

327
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,600
They start to get more challenging. They start to get more challenging.

328
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,640
What the hell? Can you attempt that?

329
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah. OK...

330
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,840
- Tongue that way.
- I go to that one and it's the other way!

331
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,400
This is really weird.

332
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,120
Very good!

333
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,920
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

334
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,880
Now, this is an opportunity for...

335
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,440
Is that casting for my next role as an otter?

336
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
No, no, you're in it. You're the star.

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is an opportunity for myself and Johnny

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,160
to channel our inner otter. This is a nice three shot.

339
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,360
LAUGHTER

340
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,400
- If you lean in, I'll lean in.
- Oh, to me?
- Yes, you're in the middle.

341
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
- Wait, wait, what's the face on the other...?
- OK, OK.

342
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,160
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

343
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
Adorable. Adorable.

344
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,480
So then, we found this picture.

345
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,000
We found this picture of an otter, look at this. Look at this.

346
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,680
Let's have a close-up of the face. You've never seen a happier creature

347
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,200
on planet Earth. Look how happy this otter is with his new teddy bear.

348
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
LAUGHTER

349
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,720
The teddy bear doesn't look very happy.

350
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,560
No, the teddy bear's quite depressed.

351
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,680
"I've been given to a mammal."

352
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,760
I sent out the command, I picked up my phone and I went,

353
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,120
"We'll need a big teddy bear."

354
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,080
However, the word "big" is relative.

355
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
They've gone with a really enormous teddy bear.

356
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,120
- So, it's over there.
- Ah!

357
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,840
- LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE 
- Wow!

358
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,720
Isn't that amazing?

359
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

360
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,800
That is genius.

361
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,760
- I've always wanted to do something...
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

362
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,720
It's just, there's something... I don't know, there's something

363
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,240
about it that makes me want to kind of do this.

364
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,600
Oh!

365
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

366
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
- Don't kick the bear! 
- Think I'm a cute otter?

367
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,280
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

368
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,720
Your otter business is over.

369
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,720
That's versatility.

370
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,000
DROWNED OUT BY APPLAUSE

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,240
Well done to all the otters.

372
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,760
We're out of time, so all that remains to do is remind everybody

373
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,800
that Black Mass is out now.

374
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,160
It's a stunning, stunning film. You're both so good in it.

375
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,280
Please, go and see it. Huge thank you to Mr Benedict Cumberbatch

376
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
and Johnny Depp, everybody.

377
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

378
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,320
Right. Right.

379
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,280
My next guests tonight are two

380
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,400
of our finest young actors.

381
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,760
One came to our attention in brilliant films

382
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,160
like the Last King Of Scotland and Atonement,

383
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,040
and then found global acclaim

384
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,040
as the young Professor Xavier in the X-Men series.

385
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,480
The other has made the leap from most successful child actor of all time

386
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,280
to star in movies like the Woman In Black and Kill Your Darlings.

387
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,720
They're now starring together in Victor Frankenstein. Here's a taste.

388
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,040
Victor.

389
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Igor.

390
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,200
- I'm so glad you've come!
- Victor, Finnegan tried to have me killed.

391
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,160
I believe he intends to kill you when you've outlived your usefulness

392
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,720
and given him what he wants.

393
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
Now, we could still get out of this, but you must stop this experiment.

394
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,360
- Father has sent you. 
- Don't be ridiculous!

395
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,240
He'll stop at nothing and you don't know what he's capable of.

396
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,280
- I don't care. 
- What?

397
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
Finnegan's motives mean nothing to me.

398
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,840
I will turn the tide of human existence here tonight

399
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,080
and this world, which has spurned me, will forever remember my name.

400
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
No, no, if you do what he asks no-one will remember

401
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,520
Frankenstein the man, only the monster.

402
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,160
Ooh, angry face!

403
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,800
Please welcome James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe.

404
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

405
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,560
INDISTINCT GREETINGS

406
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,960
- Daniel's changed! 
- I know!
- Yes.

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,760
- What happened to you? Head lice, what happened?
- Yes. Exactly.

408
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,360
I've just finished filming a film called Imperium,

409
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,600
which is about an FBI agent that goes undercover with a bunch of

410
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,200
sort of Nazi skinheads. Well, not sort of Nazi skinheads,

411
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,400
- ACTUAL Nazi skinheads. 
- It's a musical.

412
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
But you're only pretending.

413
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,080
Yes, absolutely. This is in no way reflects my political views.

414
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,280
- James, we have seen you with shaved head.
- Oh, yeah.

415
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,360
- Was this for the new X-Men? 
- Yes, where I finally go bald.

416
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,560
- So we finally find out...
- That's what it's called. X-Men - Goes Bald.

417
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Triple X. You know.

418
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,680
Is there a good reason why he goes bald or is it really dull?

419
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,480
He ends up doing something so horrible and so physically painful

420
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,520
he, literally, half pulls his hair out, half it falls out.

421
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,560
- Maybe...or maybe not.
- Were you supposed to tell us that?

422
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,680
Yeah, I know. I've just shit myself,

423
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,560
because Fox Studios - who own me -

424
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,760
might be angry with me for saying that.

425
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,080
- There is now a red dot on your forehead.
- It might be a prank.

426
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,920
Him and Magneto are just having a couple of drinks.

427
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,400
He passes out and wakes up with his eyebrows shaved off

428
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,680
and his hair and he's got no pubes.

429
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
LAUGHTER

430
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,400
Toothpaste on his nipples. You know. We've all done it.

431
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,680
You're here to talk about Victor Frankenstein,

432
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,640
- which opens next Thursday, the 3rd December.
- Yes.

433
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,040
Even the movie, cos you start the movie in your voiceover as Igor

434
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,360
and you're saying, "This is a story you know,"

435
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,200
- but it is a totally new kind of retelling of this story.
- It is.

436
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,960
You know, Frankenstein, I haven't read the book

437
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,880
and I've seen very few of the films other than Young Frankenstein.

438
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,240
He hasn't read the script, either!

439
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
It's very good. It's very good.

440
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,560
Yeah, Igor, my character, is not in the book.

441
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,440
That became a part of the legend of Frankenstein in pop culture,

442
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,880
and so if anyone was thinking, when they saw that clip,

443
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,840
"He has no hunchback," don't worry,

444
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,640
there is serious, very severe hunchback going on.

445
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,440
Lovers of hunchback acting will not be disappointed.

446
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,480
This is the movie for you.

447
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,120
"Come for the hunchback, stay for the monster."

448
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,760
It is too late to change the posters?

449
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,960
And I like sort of doing, you know, contorting myself

450
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,600
and doing weird stuff physically - that sounds wrong!

451
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,720
But I do and so, yeah, that was a lot of fun.

452
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,800
Unfortunately, I only have to do it

453
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,480
- for the first 20 pages of the script.
- Yes, because who knew

454
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,960
the good doctor "cures" the hunchback.

455
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,000
Lumbago, bunions, cold and flu, hunchback - I'm on it, mate.

456
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,280
It turns out it's disgusting but quite simple.

457
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,960
Yeah, you suck it out.

458
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,240
- My favourite scene in the film.
- You don't swallow. You don't swallow.

459
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,320
- You must swallow a bit. 
- Only to make him feel nice.

460
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,080
Make him feel like I care.

461
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,560
What a good doctor!

462
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,280
"I must go back to him."

463
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,640
Yeah, we had this thing where it was meant to be syringed out.

464
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,240
You stick a big, old medical syringe in and pull it out.

465
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,480
And the minute I read it, I thought I would love to sort of do that,

466
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,360
but also, I had this image of siphoning...when you siphon...

467
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,600
You know when you siphon petrol out of somebody's car?

468
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,000
Have you stolen diesel?

469
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,880
Yes. Not because I was going to use it, just for a laugh.

470
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,520
And I thought we should suck it

471
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,160
and get the pus flowing, as it were.

472
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,960
AUDIENCE GROANS

473
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,120
Can I say, this description is really not as disgusting as it is.

474
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,240
- It's really great.
- And then, you're going to get a bit of blowback

475
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,720
in your mouth.

476
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,320
Then, you get it out and you start it flowing and that drains the sack,

477
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,360
as it were.

478
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,360
But there was a great moment - this was not in the script -

479
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,320
James was coming up with it on set

480
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,920
and we were working out the logistics of it and were all like,

481
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,560
"This is great!" And me, James and Paul were getting excited,

482
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,880
like three kids, about this hilarious, gross,

483
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,640
brilliant idea we'd had. And then, I just remember walking off the set

484
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,200
and seeing a couple of producers clearly just thinking,

485
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,720
"What?! We need to separate them!"

486
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,120
This was our first day together on set, by the way.

487
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,640
This is James' first day on set. It was great.

488
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,040
So, now, here's a thing. We know, Daniel Radcliffe, you have

489
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,800
a reputation for being lovely to fans, very sweet,

490
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,320
you give your time freely to them, but I read with interest

491
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,520
that you are starting to toughen up now,

492
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,360
- you're being a bit more discerning with your fans.
- Erm...

493
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,280
LAUGHTER

494
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
What do you mean?

495
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Well, you were being generally nice, but you were with a friend

496
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,520
- and she kind of went... 
- Oh, yes, right!

497
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,920
Well, yeah. Well, cos I...

498
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,280
I think when you start acting at a young age,

499
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,200
people expect you to be a total dick all the time, and that is

500
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,440
the expectation you always find yourself coming up against.

501
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,680
And so, I think, all my life, I've worked hard to not be that

502
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,120
and to be as far away from that as possible.

503
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,840
But that has sometimes meant that you can be really rude to me

504
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,640
and I'll just be like, "Yeah, fine."

505
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,360
I won't notice you've been rude.

506
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,520
Sometimes, people will come up...

507
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,680
99% of the time, when people come up to you and ask you for something

508
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,160
on the street, they are really very nice and then just occasionally...

509
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,040
Somebody said, "Can I get a picture with you?"

510
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,520
I just, you know, saying words, not meaning anything by it,

511
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,360
I just said, "Oh, yeah, of course, if you want to." And she just went,

512
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,520
"Well, I wouldn't have asked if I didn't want to."

513
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,760
I was like, "No, of course, you wouldn't. How silly of me."

514
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,680
Then she left. My girlfriend was with me and she was like,

515
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,160
"That girl was a dick to you."

516
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,680
So she's given me a little bit of sense of...

517
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,840
like, you can judge that. Not that I'm a dick back now or anything.

518
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,720
But, apparently, Rupert Grint's even worse than you.

519
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,040
Rupert - I don't know the details of this at all - but Rupert ended up

520
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,600
at somebody's house one night,

521
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,880
just from continuing to say yes to things.

522
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,280
"Hey, do you want to do that? Do you want to do that?" "Yeah, yeah."

523
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,280
- We've all been there, Daniel. 
- LAUGHTER

524
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,160
I feel bad saying this cos I feel like somebody is going to take

525
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,000
advantage of that and he's going to be like the new

526
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Manchurian candidate or something.

527
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,200
Sometimes people come up to you and they don't mean to be rude,

528
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,240
- but they can be quite rude, can't they, James?
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,880
At the premiere of Suffragette - my wife had just been in a film -

530
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,640
and I thought, if anybody calls out my name, I'll sign autographs,

531
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,640
and as it happened, a few people shouted and I did that.

532
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,080
And so this woman was screaming, screaming, screaming,

533
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,080
"James! James! James! Sign my thing, sign my thing, sign my thing!"

534
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
And I came over and she went, "Oh, thank you.

535
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,800
"I'm a really big fan of SOME of your work."

536
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,120
LAUGHTER

537
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,960
"Oh, er, I think, yeah. Thank you. I'll sign SOME of your posters."

538
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,840
That was weird. People are trying to be nice.

539
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,880
Sometimes, as well, there's a thing people do, and it is particularly

540
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,200
young men with me, want to do a thing where they want me to know

541
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
that they don't give a shit about me before they ask for something.

542
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,920
So they'll be like, "Didn't really like the Harry Potter movies,

543
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,840
"but can you sign this?"

544
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,960
I'm like, "Don't do that! Say a nice thing." It's so easy.

545
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,200
I had one happen really recently at a fancy dress party where, um...

546
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,080
And this is weird, right?

547
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,800
Do you know that thing where people make a list of famous people

548
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,280
that they're allowed to have sex with if they meet them?

549
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,600
- Oh, the free pass.
- The free pass. She called it an allowance.

550
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,080
LAUGHTER

551
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,280
I was like, "What, like pocket money?

552
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,720
"How are you going to spend me?"

553
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,520
So...I met her and her fella

554
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,440
and then, she came up and said afterwards, she went,

555
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
"So, you're my allowance."

556
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,160
I was like, "I beg your... Excuse me?"

557
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,120
She went, "You know, he's cool with it and you're my thing."

558
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,320
I was like, "Er..."

559
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,560
He's not cool with it, by the way.

560
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,880
By the way, that's a whole other story.

561
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,080
I was really taken aback by it and I was like,

562
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,680
"I'm married but thank you very much, it's very nice of you."

563
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,240
Then she said this thing, it was meant as a compliment and she was

564
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,480
trying to get me to do stuff, but it was still really backhanded.

565
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,120
And she went, "Cos, you know,

566
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,720
"a lot of girls would be after somebody like Channing Tatum."

567
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,720
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

568
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,960
I was like, "Do you know what? You're no gettin' it."

569
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,920
LAUGHTER

570
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Achievable goals.

571
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,520
The thing is, if people want a picture of Daniel and you think,

572
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,160
"I'm never going to meet Daniel Radcliffe," don't worry.

573
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,960
Because have you seen - you like the internet -

574
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
have you seen this thing on Reddit?

575
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,800
I've been made aware of this, I think. Is this time travelling me?

576
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,400
Yeah, the Daniel Radcliffe time traveller.

577
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
- People post old photographs and...
- I look like everyone...
- You really do.

578
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,880
So people post old photographs and you have to scan them very carefully

579
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,040
to see if you can manage to spot who in the photograph

580
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,200
looks like Daniel Radcliffe.

581
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,040
So, can you spot Daniel Radcliffe time traveller in this picture?

582
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
LAUGHTER

583
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,000
Got him!

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,200
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

585
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,960
The next one is easier because there are three people.

586
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,000
Can you see which of the three people is Daniel Radcliffe time traveller?

587
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,240
LAUGHTER

588
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,360
- That is you!
- Pictures of me, particularly when I was younger,

589
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,880
that is very, very, very close to how I was.

590
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,800
And if Daniel Radcliffe ever went on Who Do You Think You Are?

591
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,400
At some point, surely this photograph will come up.

592
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,640
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

593
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,720
Right, it's music time.

594
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,960
This band have sold over 40 million records,

595
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,840
been nominated for two Grammys and now, after ten years

596
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,640
out of the spotlight, they're back with their sixth studio album.

597
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,120
Performing their current single, Bring On The Night,

598
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,560
please welcome the Corrs!

599
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,400
# I read the book you read

601
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,960

# Wilt like a love note

616

# Every day I'm passing by

617
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080

The Corrs, ladies and gentlemen!

656
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,920
Come and join us.

657
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,400
Come on. The Corrs, everybody!

658
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,040
Hello. Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back.

659
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,400
INDISTINCT GREETINGS

660
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
The gang's all here.

661
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,240
OK, sit down, sit down, sit down.

662
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,440
All right, just sit down!

663
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,120
Just sit down!

664
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,600
So, welcome back, the Corrs.

665
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,720
That is a track from the album White Light,

666
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,080
which, as chance would have it,

667
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,840
is out today. There you go.

APPLAUSE

669
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Got a round of applause!

670
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,880
Are you back because it's ten years?

671
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,880
It wasn't really a plan of ten years or anything like that,

672
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,680
it was kind of Caroline suggested it...last September.

673
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,120
Yeah, I just thought maybe it would be nice thing for us to perform

674
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,080
and write together again, so we finally got it together.

675
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,760
And you are touring, so when does that start?

676
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,760
- We start on the 19th. The 19th of January...
- We need the month.

677
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,640
..in Birmingham.

678
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,800
"The 19th."

679
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,080
We're doing London and Dublin and Belfast. Should be great,

680
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,800
we're looking forward to it as well, then, we branch out into Europe

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,760
- after that.
- Ladies and gentlemen, you look at this couch and you would

682
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,000
be right when you thought, "There are award-winners on that couch," cos,

683
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,040
Andrea, you're the Most Beautiful Woman in the World?

684
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,760
- A lot of years ago! 
- Stop that!

685
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,280
Untouched by time.

686
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,520
Where did you win the Most Beautiful Woman in the World title?

687
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,400
I don't actually know which poll it was.

688
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,520
Oh, look at her pretending not to remember.

689
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,360
For the last ten years, you've been getting it out going, "Look at that."

690
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,960
Every day, dusting it.

691
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,520
James, you're not the most...

692
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,080
Well... Sorry, I nearly said...

693
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,960
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You are ONE of the most Beautiful Men in the World.

694
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Not as beautiful as Channing fucking Tatum.

695
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,840
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

696
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,920
No. No, you are not.

697
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,680
- I'm about to play his boss, by the way, so, you know...
- Ooh-ho!

698
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,240
- What's that in?
- He's going to be Gambit and I'm Professor X,

699
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,000
so I can tell him to go and like, I don't know, get fat.

700
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,080
- "Eat this." In improv, just bringing doughnuts.
- Steady now.

701
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,800
No, food. But, ladies and gentlemen,

702
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,440
most exciting of all, we have a current - a CURRENT -

703
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,000
award winner. Yes, actual 2015's holder of, Daniel Radcliffe?

704
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,040
Rear of the Year.

705
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,080
CHEERING AND WHISTLING

706
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,480
- I carry it with me everywhere I go. 
- Oh, you have it!
- Absolutely!

707
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,360
Yeah, I brought it, obviously.

708
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,200
Where did you get it from?

709
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,720
- Girls, ladies, check it out. 
- Very nice.

710
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,160
It's too bright to look at.

711
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,720
It's like looking at the sun.

712
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,760
I don't mean this to come across as slightly ungrateful, but do you not

713
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,480
think, like, the Rear of the Year award should look like an arse?

714
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,120
- Like, I don't know...
- Like yours, it should be moulded perfectly.

715
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,560
Or like a hand doing that.

716
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,680
LAUGHTER

717
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,560
More like this.

718
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,720
Oh, that's good, I like that.

719
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,080
- But, still, I was chuffed. 
- Was it a glittering occasion?

720
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,480
No, it was just me in my room, voting again and again.

721
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,920
LAUGHTER

722
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,200
Did you go somewhere to pick it up?

723
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,480
No, I think they sent it to my agent.

724
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,560
- In a padded envelope? 
- Parcelforce.

725
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,320
- Well done. 
- "Can you sign for this?"

726
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
2016, James, it could be yours.

727
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm down the gym, I'm doing my squats.

728
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,040
LAUGHTER

729
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,920
Listen, Corrs, thank you very much for coming back. We missed you,

730
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,280
we're glad you're back.

731
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,360
Good luck with the album, good luck with the tour. The Corrs, everybody.

732
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

733
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,440
Before we go, you know what is going to happen now.

734
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
Yes, this week's visit to the Big Red Chair. Who's there?

735
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
- Hello. 
- Hello.

736
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,280
- You're on, yeah. Hi, how are you? 
- Petrified.

737
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,840
Oh, don't be scared. What is your name?

738
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,160
- Sylvia.
- lovely. And what do you do, Sylvia?
- Sorry?!

739
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,200
LAUGHTER

740
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,680
- What do you do?
- Ah, what do I do? I stay at home with my dog.
- OK.

741
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,640
LAUGHTER

742
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,720
- Who is looking after the dog tonight? 
- Oh, God, my husband.

743
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,000
LAUGHTER

744
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,360
She can stay in the chair, as far as I'm concerned.

745
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,120
- Where are you from originally? 
- I am Peruvian.
- Peruvian.
- Yes.

746
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,160
- I don't believe we've had a Peruvian on the Red Chair before.
- Yes.
- Yeah.

747
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,200
So... Yeah, OK.

748
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm not an acting coach or anything, I cannot read these expressions.

749
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,800
Her excitement...her face seems so upset.

750
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,080
- I am the first Peruvian to do this ridiculous thing.
- OK.

751
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,960
Sylvia, focus.

752
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,160
- You are representing Peru.
- OK. 
- Off you go with your story.

753
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,720
OK, so here we are at Heathrow with my husband and he said to me,

754
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,920
"Go and see which belt number our luggage is coming out."

755
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,600
"OK," I said. "Don't move, stay here."

756
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,840
Off I went, a few steps, came back and said, "Number this."

757
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,320
And then, I felt quite chilly.

758
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,840
Put my arm around him and then, I felt very chilly.

759
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,160
I started putting my hand inside his trouser pocket

760
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,960
when, suddenly, I felt everybody looking at me. Oh, my God.

761
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,160
I lean over, looked to the right and saw these two huge eyes.

762
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,360
They were the wife's eyes and I was embracing the wrong husband!

763
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,560
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

764
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,280
What did you want to do? You wanted that to happen.

765
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,640
Well done, the Big Red Chair. If you would like to join us on the show
