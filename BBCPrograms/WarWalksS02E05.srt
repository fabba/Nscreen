00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
*

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,240
Nearly 60 years ago, thousands of men waited on this beach for days, under repeated attack from the air.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,640
They were members of the British Expeditionary Force, now surrounded by the German army.

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,880
Most of their guns and their few tanks had been destroyed in battle or smashed to prevent capture.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,960
They were running short of food and even drinking water was scarce.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,400
Their only hope lay in rescue from the sea.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,840
For the British, evacuation would be a miracle. For their French allies, it would seem like a betrayal.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
For the men who were there,

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
soldiers and rescuers alike,

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,440
Dunkirk was an unforgettable experience.

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,200
I can remember very vividly, at that time, that the beach...

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,160
- all those sand dunes were black. 
- Those...?
- All along there.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,600
Totally black.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,080
And at intervals, a black line came down to the water,

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,720
which was, sort of... four-abreast soldiers coming down.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,880
It was a most amazing sight. And the boats were taking them off...

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,920
It was patently obvious to me at that stage

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,960
that we hadn't a hope in hell of getting a pennyworth of those chaps off.

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,400
# Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye... #

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,320
The men who ended up on the beaches at Dunkirk

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,360
had set off for France in September, 1939, full of naive optimism.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
"To our shame," said Montgomery, then a divisional commander,

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,160
"we have sent our army into that most modern of wars

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,600
"with weapons and equipment that are quite inadequate."

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,560
For nine months, the BEF - the British Expeditionary Force -

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,680
settled into life in northern France - a life which, in retrospect, was a fool's paradise.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,720
The German invasion began May 10, 1940, in the Netherlands and Belgium.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,520
But the decisive breakthrough was at Sedan,

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,560
tearing a hole in Allied defences, and heading straight for the Channel.

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,760
This road crosses the Somme battlefield of 1916.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,800
In those days, advances were measured in yards,

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,840
and their human cost is still counted in the cemeteries all around.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,680
In 1940, the Germans broke through the gap like water through a dam

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,600
and surged down these long, straight roads of northern France

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,680
past memorials to another war.

36
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,880
The Germans had developed a new technique of warfare - Blitzkrieg.

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,720
Their tanks moved swiftly ahead of the infantry, supported by aircraft,

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,280
clearing a narrow path and moving faster than the Allies could react.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,080
The German advance was relentless. The Allies collapsed before it.

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,480
On the 20th of May, the Germans reached the Channel coast here, just beyond Abbeville.

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,480
They'd advanced 40 miles in 14 hours and were astonished by their achievement.

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,520
One German commander wrote to his wife, "A blazing success.

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,560
"Now the hunt is up against 60 encircled British, French and Belgian divisions.

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,200
"Don't worry about me. As I see it, the war in France will be over in a fortnight."

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,240
The Allies were in chaos. Lord Gort was responsible for the BEF,

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,280
but was under French command, who'd just sacked a Commander-in-Chief.

47
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,320
On the 21st of May, the new French Commander-in-Chief, General Weygand,

48
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,480
called a meeting to coordinate a counter-attack. Nobody told Gort, who arrived only after Weygand left.

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,840
Gort had earlier written that the BEF was making "that retreat with which all British campaigns start."

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
He must now have wondered whether that retreat was becoming a rout.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,640
Just over 20 miles away,

52
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,040
 across the Channel in Dover,

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,400
they were also beginning to anticipate disaster.

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,480
These tunnels under Dover Castle were dug during the Napoleonic Wars.

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,520
In 1940, they were the headquarters of Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay.

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,040
By the time of Gort's aborted meeting,

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,520
Ramsay was already beginning to plan the evacuation of non-combatants from France.

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Over the days that followed, this plan would swell into the rescue of an entire army from Dunkirk.

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,840
Its code name was inspired by one of these underground chambers - Operation Dynamo.

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
At this stage, Ramsay and the Prime Minister, Churchill,

61
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,720
only planned to evacuate maybe 20,000 men, a tenth of the force.

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,760
The British must not be seen to be running out on their allies.

63
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,000
At Calais, 3,000 troops under Brigadier Claude Nicholson,

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,080
were holding on to the town under constant bombardment.

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,920
By the 23rd of May, they were effectively under siege in the ancient citadel.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,960
On the 24th of May,

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Nicholson was told that they might be evacuated. Then he was ordered to hold on for Allied solidarity.

68
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,400
Churchill was determined to show his confidence in the Alliance.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,680
Nicholson's men fought on, completely surrounded,

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,120
hopelessly outnumbered, but refusing to surrender.

71
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,240
Finally, the Germans forced their way into the citadel and captured Nicholson.

72
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,760
That evening, a message was sent from Dover:

73
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,800
"To officer commanding troops, Calais, from Secretary of State.

74
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,840
"I'm filled with admiration for your magnificent stand,

75
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,880
"which is worthy of the highest traditions of the British Army."

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,680
There was no-one here to receive it.

77
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,720
Gort's command post was in a little chateau at Premesques, west of Lille.

78
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,400
This was his own office. On the 25th of May, he was standing here studying the map.

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,760
The Germans had cut the Allied armies in half.

80
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,960
On his left, the Belgians had been fought to the very edge of collapse.

81
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,080
The French, on his right, were pressing him to participate in a counter-attack...

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,520
in which he had very little confidence.

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,440
A staff officer, Lt-Colonel Gerald Templer, had to walk through Gort's office to get to another room.

84
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,720
He described: "I walked in to see Gort in a very typical attitude, legs apart and hands behind his back,

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,720
"wrestling with his God and his duty at a moment of destiny."

86
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,440
By 6.30 that evening, Gort's mind was made up.

87
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,760
He cancelled the British contribution to the attack and ordered a retreat on Dunkirk.

88
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,400
The rout had begun.

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,120
Thousands of troops were retreating, abandoning and destroying their equipment as they went.

90
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,640
There was no way out except by sea.

91
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,680
The fall of Calais left Dunkirk the only point for an evacuation.

92
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,680
It was the third largest port in France a fortress in its own right, with a French Admiral in command.

93
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,720
But its fortifications were hopelessly obsolete, and were built to resist attack from land or sea.

94
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,720
This attack came from the air and left these docks in pieces,

95
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,240
their oil tanks blazing, casting a pall of smoke over the scene.

96
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,560
Dunkirk itself was in ruins. The plume of black smoke could be seen from Dover.

97
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Troops could not be evacuated from the ruined harbour.

98
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
The only hope lay in the ten miles of beaches to the east of the town.

99
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,520
The BEF fell back on the beaches of Dunkirk like a balloon slowly losing air.

100
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,560
But it was very difficult actually getting men off from here.

101
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,600
The sand shelves so gently that big ships couldn't get in shore

102
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,640
but had to use their lifeboats, cutters or whalers to ferry men out.

103
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,960
Less than 8,000 men were rescued that first day.

104
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,080
At this rate, most of the BEF would be captured before it could be rescued.

105
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,520
On the beaches, queues of men stretched into the water,

106
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,200
those at the head already standing up to their chests in the sea.

107
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,240
A rowing boat would appear and the head of the queue would clamber in,

108
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,480
leaving those behind praying that another one would appear, and fearing that it would not.

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,520
Head and shoulders only above the surface - fixed, immovable, as if chained there.

110
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
Then a boat would appear,

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,640
but the men were too exhausted and weighed down by sodden clothing to clamber in unaided.

112
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,200
Once hauled aboard, there was a marvellous feeling of relief. What remained was the Navy's business.

113
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,480
One of the early arrivals at the beach was Bob Brooks, then a 20-year-old gunner.

114
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,240
I remember there was a NAAFI wagon on the beach. I was very thirsty.

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,200
And I drank two tins of evaporated milk.

116
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,240
And I was probably very sick! Which taught me a lesson.

117
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,800
Um... There were, well... a few senior officers doing their best - I must say that.

118
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,960
And they were organising people into lines.

119
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,440
And we remained there until the Stukas came over.

120
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,960
 And then we all sort of, eh...

121
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,760
burrowed into the dunes, tried to make ourselves invisible.

122
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,240
And when the Stukas went we went back into line.

123
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,840
There was a long interval when no-one was being picked up,

124
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:38,200
and we were told that if we could swim, we should try and swim out to boats, which were quite a way out.

125
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,880
I did, and tried to climb a rope. I hadn't done that since school!

126
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,400
In the gym.

127
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,440
And I suppose the combination of tiredness

128
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,480
and the fact that we hadn't eaten anything for two or three days,

129
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,160
and the drag of the water...

130
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,200
I just about got myself out of the water and I couldn't climb any higher.

131
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,240
And so we had to drop off and come back to the beach.

132
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,920
When one got back to the beach, one had to go to the end of the queue.

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,440
The evacuation itself might be painfully slow,

134
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,920
but for men to have even a chance of reaching Dunkirk, others must keep fighting to hold the Germans back.

135
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,080
In fields and farmhouses, beside canals and in blockhouses,

136
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,640
small groups of men stood their ground to keep the Germans from Dunkirk.

137
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,880
The little town of Cassel, behind me, overlooks the Flanders plain.

138
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,560
It was held by a scratch force of British and French troops.

139
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,600
This bunker, part of a pre-war French defence line, was garrisoned by a platoon of the Gloucesters -

140
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,640
13 men under a young second lieutenant, Roy Cresswell.

141
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,240
They held out under constant attack for three whole days with no food and little water.

142
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,280
It was only when an ominous silence from Cassel told them that they were on their own that they gave up.

143
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,120
By that stage, the Germans were on the roof.

144
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,720
Roy Cresswell and his men spent the rest of the war in captivity. In a way, they were lucky.

145
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
In other cases, the old rules of war no longer applied.

146
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Wormhoudt, about 12 miles from Dunkirk, was stoutly held.

147
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,000
Some of its defenders, most of them Royal Warwickshires, eventually surrendered to SS troops.

148
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,320
They were herded into a barn just behind them. The Germans threw grenades in...

149
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,840
and shot the survivors.

150
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,360
We don't know how many were killed

151
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,360
because the Germans scattered the bodies to conceal evidence of the massacre,

152
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,880
but at least 60 men died.

153
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,440
The journey to Dunkirk itself was fraught with danger.

154
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Men were retreating, sometimes in disorder,

155
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,480
often without rations and with no orders other than "Make for Dunkirk. Every man for himself."

156
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,000
They were constantly under fire.

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,040
Even here, yards from the beaches, are the marks of the shell splinters that spattered the fleeing troops.

158
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,000
The ships answering the call to France also faced a dangerous journey.

159
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,280
They suffered repeated attack by air and were at the mercy of mines and torpedoes by sea.

160
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:04,520
Over 220 of them were sunk during Dunkirk, many with rescued soldiers on board.

161
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,280
Among the ships arriving at Dunkirk

162
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,320
was MTB - Motor Torpedo Boat - 102, then the fastest ship in the Royal Navy.

163
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
MTP 102 was the prototype of a new breed of small warship.

164
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
She was commanded by Lt Christopher Dreyer.

165
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
The soldiers were all desperately tired,

166
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
demoralised, frightened...

167
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,840
At intervals, ME-109s - the German fighters -

168
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,280
used to come flying along the beach and shoot up everything in sight.

169
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,000
And three Stuka bombers just set about us,

170
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,200
going back to Dunkirk, along here - just about where we are now. We were belting along.

171
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,520
Flat out. And she was very fast, this boat, in those days. She could do about 48 knots flat out.

172
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,600
If you did the telegraphs "full ahead" three times,

173
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,680
- it meant, like... "I really mean it."
- "Go like smoke." 
- "Give everything." And he did.

174
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,360
But even so, a stick of three bombs disappeared from sight

175
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,000
under the transom there.

176
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,520
And that was very frightening.

177
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,720
The 22-year-old Lt Dreyer was shocked by the chaos he saw on the beaches.

178
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,280
One major problem for everybody

179
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,320
was that the soldiers piled on to the side of the boat...

180
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,560
crazy keen to get in and get away from this ghastly place,

181
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
and, em...tipped a lot of them over.

182
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,040
And there was, you know... an awfully sadly indisciplined performance, the whole thing.

183
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,720
And very slow and very inefficient.

184
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,240
Em... So that it was...it was...

185
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,000
To my mind, it was AWFULLY clear at the beginning

186
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,080
that that was no way to conduct the operation!

187
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,120
You'd never get this black horde off the beaches in that way.

188
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,080
On the 27th of May, less than 8,000 men were rescued and the port itself was still burning.

189
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,600
Then somebody noticed

190
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,640
that the two moles, or breakwaters, jutting into the sea were undamaged.

191
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,680
The eastern mole, by far the longer of the two, was especially promising.

192
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,080
But there were serious practical problems in using it.

193
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,640
The tide rises and falls by 15 feet.

194
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,000
It's a long way from the water to the top of the mole, even at high tide.

195
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,040
This section is modern. The original was flimsier,

196
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,080
with no guarantee that big ships could use it.

197
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,640
On the 28th, a passenger steamer, Queen Of The Channel, came alongside.

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,280
She got away with 1,000 men.

199
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,880
Bombers sank her in the Channel, but she proved the mole would work.

200
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,000
The mole transformed operations,

201
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,160
allowing up to 2,000 men an hour to be rescued,

202
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
piling off it directly on to destroyers and other large ships.

203
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,960
The surprisingly calm spring weather was another blessing.

204
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,880
The Germans had also inadvertently offered the BEF a crucial stay of execution.

205
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,920
They'd halted their advance, giving the British an extra two days.

206
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,400
But by May 28th, the advance had begun again.

207
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,440
On the same day, the Luftwaffe finally bombed the mole,

208
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,480
blowing a hole in it and sinking and damaging shipping on both sides.

209
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,520
For a while it seemed that the mole could no longer be used.

210
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,560
The beaches would have to play a fuller part,

211
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,000
and that would require more ships - especially little ones.

212
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,040
From Ramsay's headquarters, the message went out that the small ships were desperately required.

213
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,080
Ramsay had already been ordered to withdraw all modern destroyers from Operation Dynamo,

214
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,680
leaving him with only 15 old ones.

215
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,720
Churchill now declared that the British and French would be evacuated on equal terms.

216
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,840
That meant even more troops to be taken off mole and beaches alike.

217
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,880
Big ships, little ships all had their part to play.

218
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,120
The call for small ships was quickly answered.

219
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,160
Pleasure boats and tugs, fishing smacks and cabin cruisers,

220
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,840
sailing barges and motor yachts -

221
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,280
some manned by their owners, others by the Navy.

222
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,320
They sailed, most of them, up the Thames to Sheerness and on here to Ramsgate.

223
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,480
Here they were given charts and water before setting sail for France and the beaches of Dunkirk.

224
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,520
This is Sundowner. She was built in 1912 as an Admiralty steam launch

225
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:24,880
and in 1930 was converted into a private motor yacht for her new owner, Commander Charles Lightoller.

226
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,400
Lightoller had been an officer aboard the Titanic.

227
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,440
On June 1st, Lightoller, his son Roger, and an 18-year-old Sea Scout called George Ashcroft

228
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,960
took Sundowner to Dunkirk.

229
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,480
They stopped to take five men off a burning motor cruiser and went on to the mole under fierce air attack.

230
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,520
Lightoller got another 122 men aboard and set off for home.

231
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,760
Like all the ships, large or small, rescuing men from Dunkirk,

232
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Sundowner was a tempting target for German dive bombers.

233
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:25,440
Another son, an RAF pilot shot down the year before, had discussed evasive tactics with his father,

234
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,000
and as German aircraft dived in to machine-gun Sundowner, Lightoller veered just before they opened fire.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,920
He got back to Ramsgate safely, but wrote that with so many men aboard, many of them very seasick,

236
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,440
there was a nice cleaning-up job.

237
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,480
Not all the small ships arrived home safely.

238
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,360
The courage shown by their largely civilian crews was a powerful boost to British morale.

239
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,640
As Dunkirk continued to burn under constant bombing, the German troops came ever closer.

240
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,120
There were still thousands of men on the beaches and the dunes behind them, waiting to be rescued.

241
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,920
One Royal Artillery unit halted just behind the dunes and sent an officer forward to whistle up the Navy.

242
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:24,320
The officer thought his task was hopeless, but he found "Call to an unknown ship" in his signal manual

243
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,360
and dutifully stood up here and flashed it out to sea.

244
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,520
Against all odds, there was an answering flicker in the dark, and a ship duly appeared.

245
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,160
But time was running out and the Germans were now breathing down their necks.

246
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:00,600
This is the last ditch, the canal line that marked the defensive perimeter of Dunkirk.

247
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,920
By May 31st, it was all that stood between the Germans and the port.

248
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,120
The canal was filled with abandoned vehicles. The surrounding fields had been flooded to delay German tanks.

249
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,560
This sector was held by about 70 men

250
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,160
 of the East Lancashire Regiment.

251
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,840
On the morning of the 1st of June, the Germans crossed the canal on both sides of them.

252
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,440
They'd been told to hold to the last round and they did exactly that. Almost half were killed or wounded.

253
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,480
The survivors escaped by wading up to their necks for over a mile down this side canal.

254
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,800
Actions like this bought time for thousands more to reach the beaches.

255
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,840
From there, they were ferried to England by men who were themselves feeling the strain of battle.

256
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,240
Back in Dover, the naval and civilian crews were now exhausted.

257
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,640
By the first of June, the crews of several passenger steamers were refusing to return to Dunkirk.

258
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,120
They were civilians and couldn't face another trip across the Channel with its mines, torpedoes and Stukas.

259
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,920
But they were replaced by Navy men and the stream of vessels across the Channel continued.

260
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,640
By June 2nd, over a quarter of a million soldiers had been rescued from Dunkirk.

261
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,320
Men arrived here in their thousands,

262
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,720
wounded on stretchers, French and Belgian soldiers, even German prisoners.

263
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,200
The shocked, the exhausted, but above all the enormously relieved.

264
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,480
Most of them landed in those docks and then crossed to the harbour station. And what a welcome they got.

265
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,960
"I thought we'd be shot for neglect of duty," said a Yorkshire gunner. "It looks like we're bloody heroes."

266
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,840
- Glad to be back, boys?
- > Sure!

267
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,240
Just before midnight on June 2nd, a signal from senior naval officer, Dunkirk,

268
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,040
was received here in Ramsay's headquarters.

269
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,880
It said simply, "BEF evacuated."

270
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,360
Yet it was not quite over. The French were still fighting around Dunkirk

271
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,400
and Churchill was anxious that they should not be sacrificed.

272
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,800
So Ramsay sent some ships back for one last try.

273
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:54,280
Among the ships which returned for that last night was MTB 102, still commanded by Lt Dreyer.

274
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,960
It was his seventh trip.

275
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,240
I must say, I was desperately tired by that time.

276
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,800
I kept dropping off and waking up suddenly and finding I was pointing quite in the wrong direction.

277
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:18,400
But by the last stages of the night, um... it really was quite a moving thing

278
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,920
because we were very conscious

279
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:27,960
that left behind there was a line of French soldiers who weren't going to get taken off.

280
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,600
And they didn't. And they just stood there in line, at attention...

281
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,080
absolutely immovable.

282
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,560
It was a very moving sight, that one.

283
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,600
Among the French soldiers waiting in Dunkirk was a young Jean Becaert.

284
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,000
By the morning of the 4th of June, the Germans had taken Dunkirk. The British had gone.

285
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Behind them they'd left their dead,

286
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,360
and a France which, within weeks,

287
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,960
would surrender to the armies of the Third Reich.

288
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,400
On a clear day,

289
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,920
you can see France from Dover.

290
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:02,240
And in June 1940, Admiral Ramsay could stand on this balcony and glimpse the smoke over Dunkirk.

291
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,280
Operation Dynamo had been an outstanding success -

292
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,360
338,000 men brought safely across a mine-infested sea.

293
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,840
The myth of Dunkirk was born - a triumph snatched from the jaws of defeat.

294
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,880
But it was a triumph born out of disaster and Churchill knew it.

295
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,920
"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory," he warned.

296
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,560
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

297
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,640
- WINSTON CHURCHILL: 
- We shall defend our island...

298
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,440
and with the British Empire around us, we shall fight on, unconquerable,

299
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,280
until the curse of Hitler is lifted from the brows of men.

300
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,600
We are sure that, in the end, all will be well.

301
