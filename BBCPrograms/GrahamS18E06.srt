1
0:00:00,0000 --> 0:00:07,9890
On tonight's show, all the  ingredients for a perfect line-up:

2
0:00:08,0000 --> 0:00:17,9890
The amazingly talented star  of the new film "Burnt"?

3
0:00:18,0000 --> 0:00:22,9890
Good. Oh, and a charismatic,  debonair and hilarious host?

4
0:00:23,0000 --> 0:00:58,9890
Is everyone excited  about Hallowe'en?

5
0:00:59,0000 --> 0:01:05,9890
Have you all got your pumpkins  carved and your costumes ready?

6
0:01:06,0000 --> 0:01:16,9890
But, ladies and gentlemen,  no tricks tonight, just treats.

7
0:01:17,0000 --> 0:01:20,9890
We've got  a really fantastic line-up for you.

8
0:01:21,0000 --> 0:01:30,9890
Later we'll have music from  the one and only Mr Justin Bieber!

9
0:01:31,0000 --> 0:01:32,9890
And before that,  how fantastic is this?

10
0:01:33,0000 --> 0:01:37,9890
Making her first appearance  on a British chat show in 42 years

11
0:01:38,0000 --> 0:01:54,9890
Yes, her last British chat show  was 1973 - you weren't even born.

12
0:01:55,0000 --> 0:01:59,9890
You should have seen her face  when she heard she was coming

13
0:02:00,0000 --> 0:02:06,9890
Dame Maggie will be talking about  her new film, The Lady In The Van

14
0:02:07,0000 --> 0:02:12,9890
She's the home-grown actress whose  Hollywood star has risen with her

15
0:02:13,0000 --> 0:02:15,9890
recent performances in Foxcatcher,  and American Sniper.

16
0:02:16,0000 --> 0:02:17,9890
Now starring  in the new kitchen drama Burnt,

17
0:02:18,0000 --> 0:02:32,9890
CHEERING. Hello! Wow! You won an  Oscar. You look beautiful. Lovely to

18
0:02:33,0000 --> 0:02:33,9890
see you.  And he's the breakout star

19
0:02:34,0000 --> 0:02:36,9890
of the Hangover movies,  who has since received three Oscar

20
0:02:37,0000 --> 0:02:38,9890
nominations in a row for  Silver Linings Playbook, American

21
0:02:39,0000 --> 0:02:40,9890
Hustle, and American Sniper.  It's a warm welcome back to

22
0:02:41,0000 --> 0:03:03,9890
Bradley Cooper!  CHEERING. Yay! Hello. How you doing?

23
0:03:04,0000 --> 0:03:13,9890
That's a pretty couch isn't it?  Quite comfy. Sienna Miller looks

24
0:03:14,0000 --> 0:03:21,9890
like an Oscar. Very sparkly. Old  ugly corner over here. We were

25
0:03:22,0000 --> 0:03:27,9890
talking about the first time I was  on here. She has never been on this

26
0:03:28,0000 --> 0:03:30,9890
show before. It is a unique  environment, because you are very

27
0:03:31,0000 --> 0:03:35,9890
vulnerable. I feel quite shy. I  remember the first time I was on.

28
0:03:36,0000 --> 0:03:37,9890
Liam Neeson was late and we were on  for an hour-and-a-half. What was he

29
0:03:38,0000 --> 0:03:53,9890
doing? He was coming from...  We'll talk about Burnt more,

30
0:03:54,0000 --> 0:04:03,9890
but one of the things that struck me  For you, Sienna, is it's nice to

31
0:04:04,0000 --> 0:04:11,9890
kind of be filming in London?  When you were filming in London

32
0:04:12,0000 --> 0:04:14,9890
before, people were taking pictures,  paparazzi, but you don't really

33
0:04:15,0000 --> 0:04:17,9890
have that so much any more.  How did the shutters come down

34
0:04:18,0000 --> 0:04:20,9890
on that?  I secretly filmed them

35
0:04:21,0000 --> 0:04:23,9890
on what looks like a lighter  but was actually a camera for about

36
0:04:24,0000 --> 0:04:26,9890
two years, it was proper spy stuff.  And, yeah, basically built up a case

37
0:04:27,0000 --> 0:04:30,9890
and took it to court and got an  injunction, so it's illegal for them

38
0:04:31,0000 --> 0:04:34,9890
to follow or sit outside the house.  If you're coming out

39
0:04:35,0000 --> 0:04:36,9890
of somewhere like a premiere, you  I have to say real quick, so,

40
0:04:37,0000 --> 0:04:41,9890
she told me this  and I was doing The Elephant Man,

41
0:04:42,0000 --> 0:04:50,9890
and sometimes paparazzi would follow  They had a camera at the side of the

42
0:04:51,0000 --> 0:04:56,9890
place I was staying, and another  The guy who I drive with, George,

43
0:04:57,0000 --> 0:05:00,9890
his uncle, who is a black cab  driver, came and we had a whole

44
0:05:01,0000 --> 0:05:04,9890
thing, we were going to get them.  No-one followed us.

45
0:05:05,0000 --> 0:05:05,9890
Nothing.  Nothing!

46
0:05:06,0000 --> 0:05:09,9890
Absolutely nothing.  LAUGHTER. I was going to say,

47
0:05:10,0000 --> 0:05:12,9890
you do get bothered in the States.  Not that much, you know,

48
0:05:13,0000 --> 0:05:16,9890
it's not that bad.  It's more

49
0:05:17,0000 --> 0:05:18,9890
in Europe, sometimes you go  There was

50
0:05:19,0000 --> 0:05:21,9890
an unfortunate paparazzi shot.  The thing is, you have a sixth sense

51
0:05:22,0000 --> 0:05:28,9890
of when you're getting captured.  This was a couple of years ago, but

52
0:05:29,0000 --> 0:05:32,9890
I do remember being outside.  I had this little house in Venice,

53
0:05:33,0000 --> 0:05:36,9890
the front door just opened right to  I was putting my dog, I think,

54
0:05:37,0000 --> 0:05:39,9890
in the back of  You could hear the click,

55
0:05:40,0000 --> 0:05:43,9890
just hear it.  I thought, oh yeah,

56
0:05:44,0000 --> 0:05:49,9890
these pants are really tight,  And then, like, you go online

57
0:05:50,0000 --> 0:05:56,9890
and bam, they've got it!  In fairness, they did,

58
0:05:57,0000 --> 0:06:14,9890
we've got it there.  APPLAUSE. Burnt opens next Friday,

59
0:06:15,0000 --> 0:06:20,9890
6th. This movie is about a chef. It  is the first film I've seen that

60
0:06:21,0000 --> 0:06:25,9890
really captures that stress and how  thrilling it is to be in a proper

61
0:06:26,0000 --> 0:06:31,9890
kitchen, a proper catering kitchen.  Good, we tried to do that. In this

62
0:06:32,0000 --> 0:06:36,9890
you are a former wild child who's  trying to redeem himself? Yes, it's

63
0:06:37,0000 --> 0:06:46,9890
a guy who had a lot of success early  on in Paris, a young chef. Blew it

64
0:06:47,0000 --> 0:06:50,9890
up, and you meet him. He had a  self-imposed penance in New Orleans

65
0:06:51,0000 --> 0:06:54,9890
where he wanted to chuck oysters to  clear his head. OK! I worked in

66
0:06:55,0000 --> 0:07:00,9890
kitchens and I know you have  experience. The pressure is just

67
0:07:01,0000 --> 0:07:05,9890
like nothing else. But this level,  this two Michelin star I've never

68
0:07:06,0000 --> 0:07:10,9890
experienced. We've got to train with  some amazing chefs. You play the

69
0:07:11,0000 --> 0:07:16,9890
protege? A sous chef, yes. But  better than that. Well, I think so,

70
0:07:17,0000 --> 0:07:22,9890
but technically yes, a sous chef  with an interesting haircut. I

71
0:07:23,0000 --> 0:07:29,9890
begged her to do the movie. We were  doing American sniper. I begged her

72
0:07:30,0000 --> 0:07:35,9890
to do it and she showed up on set  the first day the back of her head

73
0:07:36,0000 --> 0:07:40,9890
shaved and tattoos. If you see the  movie, she's unbelievable. You are

74
0:07:41,0000 --> 0:07:45,9890
both great in it. Thank you. You  were incredible. ? Thank you, so is

75
0:07:46,0000 --> 0:07:49,9890
he. The training, is it a skill you  learn so that you can do it in that

76
0:07:50,0000 --> 0:07:54,9890
moment, or can you now recreate that  food in your house? A lot of things

77
0:07:55,0000 --> 0:08:00,9890
go in and out for me. You train a  lot, you can do it for that time and

78
0:08:01,0000 --> 0:08:04,9890
then it's gone. What about you? I  can cook fish really well, because I

79
0:08:05,0000 --> 0:08:13,9890
think I cooked 500 pieces of it  before filming. That stayed. I was

80
0:08:14,0000 --> 0:08:18,9890
taught to fillet a turbot, which  seems inane, but it is like a ryes

81
0:08:19,0000 --> 0:08:24,9890
no Ross that's been squashed, like  leather. I went to the farmer's

82
0:08:25,0000 --> 0:08:31,9890
market and asked for a whole tur  bet. It cost a fortune. I just

83
0:08:32,0000 --> 0:08:38,9890
hacked at it. It was awful. Got the  kitchen scissors out. My child

84
0:08:39,0000 --> 0:08:41,9890
started crying. I was like, shut up!  We were really doing it in a

85
0:08:42,0000 --> 0:08:45,9890
functioning kitchen and all the  other people were chefs in

86
0:08:46,0000 --> 0:08:53,9890
Michelin-starred restaurants. We  would do 25 minute takes. It was

87
0:08:54,0000 --> 0:08:57,9890
crazy. I do remember, there was one  scene where I'm doing grouse. I was

88
0:08:58,0000 --> 0:09:02,9890
leaning up against it and I thought  I am OK with stuff. I thought I was

89
0:09:03,0000 --> 0:09:08,9890
going to faint. I was going to pass  out. When you cut the head off?

90
0:09:09,0000 --> 0:09:12,9890
Yeah, and I remember, and I stayed  aft because I wanted to make sure

91
0:09:13,0000 --> 0:09:18,9890
there were no close-ups that weren't  my hands. It was like a big deal. It

92
0:09:19,0000 --> 0:09:23,9890
takes time because I'm not a real  chef. I thought, oh my God I'm going

93
0:09:24,0000 --> 0:09:30,9890
to pass out, the whole day is going  to be gone. I was leaning and I had

94
0:09:31,0000 --> 0:09:34,9890
to be as close as I could. My hand  started shaking. It was really

95
0:09:35,0000 --> 0:09:43,9890
intense. It's crazy what they do. It  is a bit like the fashion world. You

96
0:09:44,0000 --> 0:09:50,9890
really got a sense of it. I had to  stand up for that. You trained as a

97
0:09:51,0000 --> 0:09:57,9890
mime? That was pretty incredible. I  saw the grouse.

98
0:09:58,0000 --> 0:10:02,9890
LAUGHTER. Listen, let's watch a clip  from Burnt. This is you both in the

99
0:10:03,0000 --> 0:10:11,9890
kitchen discussing your philosophy  of food. Cooking is an express of

100
0:10:12,0000 --> 0:10:16,9890
what, tell me? At its best, of  sustaining someone, of love. Aal

101
0:10:17,0000 --> 0:10:23,9890
Jones of Ed the Langham is one of  the most interesting places. What do

102
0:10:24,0000 --> 0:10:28,9890
you like, one of or interesting? We  should be dealing in culinary other

103
0:10:29,0000 --> 0:10:33,9890
gasles. Aling in culinary other  gasles. When was -- orgasms. Remind

104
0:10:34,0000 --> 0:10:40,9890
me never to discuss food with you in  public. I want to make food that

105
0:10:41,0000 --> 0:10:48,9890
people stop eating. You're being  stupid. Cooking is an expression of

106
0:10:49,0000 --> 0:10:52,9890
who we are. We are two stars, this  is a two-star review. I want people

107
0:10:53,0000 --> 0:10:55,9890
to sit that the table and be sick  with longing and I need you to do it

108
0:10:56,0000 --> 0:11:13,9890
with me.  APPLAUSE. Bradley Cooper and little

109
0:11:14,0000 --> 0:11:19,9890
Lord Fauntleroy. I heard you talking  of restaurant etiquette that none of

110
0:11:20,0000 --> 0:11:23,9890
us would have thought of. In a  Michelin restaurant food can only

111
0:11:24,0000 --> 0:11:32,9890
sit on the pass for two minutes.  Longer than that and they throw it

112
0:11:33,0000 --> 0:11:37,9890
away. If you have your starter and  some asshole goes off for a wee,

113
0:11:38,0000 --> 0:11:43,9890
they have to start again. It is a  real juggling act. You don't even

114
0:11:44,0000 --> 0:11:46,9890
consider it. You can't smoke in  restaurants anywhere, which is a

115
0:11:47,0000 --> 0:11:52,9890
nightmare for the kitchen, because  people are constantly going up. What

116
0:11:53,0000 --> 0:11:57,9890
I think is worst is when the food  arrives and they say, I'm just going

117
0:11:58,0000 --> 0:12:02,9890
to the toilet, like they are making  room.

118
0:12:03,0000 --> 0:12:12,9890
LAUGHTER. They look at themselves...  Back in a minute! I can gauge it

119
0:12:13,0000 --> 0:12:19,9890
now. I wasn't sure what I was  getting. Oh my God. The thing I want

120
0:12:20,0000 --> 0:12:26,9890
to know, is it true the thing in the  film, or are we allowed to say this?

121
0:12:27,0000 --> 0:12:30,9890
Say it. About how you can spot the  inspectors? It is more crazy than

122
0:12:31,0000 --> 0:12:34,9890
that. The fork is maybe a little  general, but in certain kitchens

123
0:12:35,0000 --> 0:12:38,9890
they have mugshots, all these photos  of people they think are part of the

124
0:12:39,0000 --> 0:12:42,9890
Michelin guide, so they are  constantly looking out. It is

125
0:12:43,0000 --> 0:12:49,9890
unbelievable the depths they go to.  It is hard for them to know. It is

126
0:12:50,0000 --> 0:12:55,9890
harder in America but in yomp it is  easier. Is it the same guys in

127
0:12:56,0000 --> 0:13:04,9890
Europe? There's 40 or 50 of them, I  kind of made that number up. It felt

128
0:13:05,0000 --> 0:13:09,9890
right. I believed you. Putting the  fork under the table, explain that

129
0:13:10,0000 --> 0:13:14,9890
to that. The fork under the table to  see if anybody notices it. They

130
0:13:15,0000 --> 0:13:21,9890
don't drop the fork? Though, they  place it. They'll see if you notice

131
0:13:22,0000 --> 0:13:30,9890
there's a missing fork. Wow! Don't  try that at Nando's. We've all...

132
0:13:31,0000 --> 0:13:35,9890
What a Nando's? I want a Nando's  bro. You don't have it in America?

133
0:13:36,0000 --> 0:13:43,9890
You would love it. What is it? A lot  of chicken. A chicken place? Chicken

134
0:13:44,0000 --> 0:13:45,9890
done several ways. That can be on  their poster, Sienna Miller, it's

135
0:13:46,0000 --> 0:13:56,9890
like chicken.  Were you a waitress? I was for a

136
0:13:57,0000 --> 0:14:00,9890
day, it didn't go well, I had  several very short-term jobs. Some

137
0:14:01,0000 --> 0:14:06,9890
man was inappropriate and I  accidentally on purpose but passed

138
0:14:07,0000 --> 0:14:17,9890
on his lap. Don't mess with CNN.  That was good. Did he walk out? It

139
0:14:18,0000 --> 0:14:21,9890
didn't work. -- don't mess with CNN  Vela -- Sienna. I was a prep cook

140
0:14:22,0000 --> 0:14:25,9890
between high school and college at  an Italian place. Through college I

141
0:14:26,0000 --> 0:14:31,9890
was a horrible way to. Genuinely bad  or did you hate it? I was back, the

142
0:14:32,0000 --> 0:14:37,9890
guy who hired me was a friend, he  said, Bradley, you are literally the

143
0:14:38,0000 --> 0:14:41,9890
worst waiter I've ever seen. But you  have sad eyes, I will keep you.

144
0:14:42,0000 --> 0:14:49,9890
LAUGHTER  You know what? It's so funny, I'm

145
0:14:50,0000 --> 0:14:52,9890
still friends with him, he's the  manager of this restaurant in

146
0:14:53,0000 --> 0:14:56,9890
Washington, DC, I see him all the  time. Indie film you speak French.

147
0:14:57,0000 --> 0:15:00,9890
And you speak French as well. He can  speak fluent French. I speak one

148
0:15:01,0000 --> 0:15:07,9890
line of French. Didn't you study  there? I did, spring semester of my

149
0:15:08,0000 --> 0:15:11,9890
junior year of college I went to the  south and studied there. How would

150
0:15:12,0000 --> 0:15:21,9890
you urge people to see the film,  Burnt, in French? That was good!

151
0:15:22,0000 --> 0:15:33,9890
CHEERING  Why wouldn't you? Brulee. Hole I

152
0:15:34,0000 --> 0:15:42,9890
like Brulee, they should do that  instead.

153
0:15:43,0000 --> 0:15:52,9890
The other thing is and we last saw  you, you took the most famous selfie

154
0:15:53,0000 --> 0:15:57,9890
in the world, at the Oscars. By  mistake. It wasn't planned, I was

155
0:15:58,0000 --> 0:16:02,9890
actually trying to... I completely  messed up talented generous's joke,

156
0:16:03,0000 --> 0:16:06,9890
she was trying to make a joke about  her and Meryl Streep, that she

157
0:16:07,0000 --> 0:16:17,9890
couldn't take a selfie with Meryl  Streep. I thought, something is

158
0:16:18,0000 --> 0:16:22,9890
wrong. -- Ellen de Generes. Due was  like, Bradley, as got it. She's

159
0:16:23,0000 --> 0:16:27,9890
constantly saying, it's OK. And then  she made this goal, she said,

160
0:16:28,0000 --> 0:16:31,9890
everybody start coming behind her.  She started taking it. I was there,

161
0:16:32,0000 --> 0:16:40,9890
my arm was longer, took over, I was  like, I've got it. Here it is. Who

162
0:16:41,0000 --> 0:16:47,9890
is that? That you didn't quite get?  I think it's Jarrod O. Angelina

163
0:16:48,0000 --> 0:16:54,9890
Jolie didn't get the concept, you  have to be able to see yourself. --

164
0:16:55,0000 --> 0:17:03,9890
Jared Leto. It's like something out  of Harry Potter. The evil beast.

165
0:17:04,0000 --> 0:17:11,9890
Yeah. I wish I knew his name, this  guy. It was so sweet, you thought,

166
0:17:12,0000 --> 0:17:16,9890
I'll do it. Look how much space he  has come of the most real estate.

167
0:17:17,0000 --> 0:17:26,9890
Poor Meryl Streep, she's hardly...  Belly I love Kevin 's busy. Perfect.

168
0:17:27,0000 --> 0:17:32,9890
-- I love Kevin Spacey. I've found  my space and my light. The whole

169
0:17:33,0000 --> 0:17:37,9890
selfie thing, that was the most  famous. Now they are everywhere,

170
0:17:38,0000 --> 0:17:39,9890
everybody takes selfies. There is a  new sort of selfie.

171
0:17:40,0000 --> 0:17:41,9890
Are you aware of this thing,  nutscaping?

172
0:17:42,0000 --> 0:17:51,9890
What you do is, you're oot  and aboot and you see just a wonder

173
0:17:52,0000 --> 0:18:03,9890
You basically, you drop  your testicles into the picture.

174
0:18:04,0000 --> 0:18:06,9890
LAUGHTER. A picture...  paints a thousand words.

175
0:18:07,0000 --> 0:18:54,9890
LAUGHTER. There's something  wrong with that nut.

176
0:18:55,0000 --> 0:19:17,9890
What do we know?  We're cows.

177
0:19:18,0000 --> 0:19:22,9890
This one is beautiful,  it's incredibly artistic.

178
0:19:23,0000 --> 0:19:42,9890
Listen, it's been absolutely lovely  talking to you. Both of you. Good

179
0:19:43,0000 --> 0:19:45,9890
luck with the movie Burnt, it opens  next Friday. Thank Sienna Miller and

180
0:19:46,0000 --> 0:19:52,9890
Bradley Cooper!  One is a multi-award-winning actor

181
0:19:53,0000 --> 0:19:57,9890
who gave us his Prince Charles  The other is possibly this country's

182
0:19:58,0000 --> 0:20:00,9890
most treasured actress, a double  Oscar winner and the main reason

183
0:20:01,0000 --> 0:20:05,9890
the world loves Downton Abbey.  They're currently starring together

184
0:20:06,0000 --> 0:20:07,9890
in the big screen adaptation of  Alan Bennett's The Lady in

185
0:20:08,0000 --> 0:20:21,9890
the Van - here they are in action.  In your drive? That never occurred

186
0:20:22,0000 --> 0:20:25,9890
to me. I don't know, it might not be  convenient. I thought it over,

187
0:20:26,0000 --> 0:20:30,9890
believe me, Miss Shepherd, it's all  right, just till you sort yourself

188
0:20:31,0000 --> 0:20:34,9890
out. Not convenient for you,  convenient for me. You're not doing

189
0:20:35,0000 --> 0:20:38,9890
me a favour, you know, I have other  fish to fry. A man on the pavements

190
0:20:39,0000 --> 0:20:46,9890
told me if I went south of the river  I'd be welcomed with open arms.

191
0:20:47,0000 --> 0:20:50,9890
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome  Alex Jennings and Dame Maggie Smith!

192
0:20:51,0000 --> 0:21:00,9890
CHEERING  APPLAUSE

193
0:21:01,0000 --> 0:21:27,9890
It's a big deal, they don't stand up  for people. Did they stand up? They

194
0:21:28,0000 --> 0:21:33,9890
did, not all of them, but some of  them did, the ones that could do it.

195
0:21:34,0000 --> 0:21:38,9890
Thank you. We're thrilled, we never  thought this day would come. Neither

196
0:21:39,0000 --> 0:21:46,9890
did I. It's a long time since the  last one. Alex Jennings I'm ignoring

197
0:21:47,0000 --> 0:21:51,9890
you, hello. Hello. You are both so  good in this film, terrific, it's

198
0:21:52,0000 --> 0:21:58,9890
fantastic. The Lady in the Van opens  on the 13th of November. Which is a

199
0:21:59,0000 --> 0:22:04,9890
Friday. LAUGHTER  Say no more. In that clip we got the

200
0:22:05,0000 --> 0:22:12,9890
idea you are delayed in the van.  Yeah. -- UART The Lady in the Van.

201
0:22:13,0000 --> 0:22:17,9890
Miss Shepherd was real? Miss  Shepherd was very real and very

202
0:22:18,0000 --> 0:22:21,9890
frightening. She was real, and the  fact: Put up with her for so long is

203
0:22:22,0000 --> 0:22:26,9890
beyond anybody's comprehension.  Nobody understands that. 15 years.

204
0:22:27,0000 --> 0:22:36,9890
She was in that van outside his  window. The film begins with him

205
0:22:37,0000 --> 0:22:40,9890
describing peace now. Don't! And you  play... Two different versions of

206
0:22:41,0000 --> 0:22:45,9890
Alan Bennett. I do Paige different  versions, the writer, who is

207
0:22:46,0000 --> 0:22:50,9890
observing Alan Bennett, as it were,  having a life, or not having a life,

208
0:22:51,0000 --> 0:22:53,9890
wishing he was having a more  exciting life so he could write

209
0:22:54,0000 --> 0:23:00,9890
about things other than old ladies.  Was Alan Bennett there the whole

210
0:23:01,0000 --> 0:23:05,9890
time? Yeah, it was creepy, there  were so many of them. They were

211
0:23:06,0000 --> 0:23:10,9890
everywhere, all over. Gloucester  Crescent was it? It was the more we

212
0:23:11,0000 --> 0:23:13,9890
filmed it in the house where it all  happened. That is extraordinary, it

213
0:23:14,0000 --> 0:23:18,9890
never happens with a film where you  get a film on the street. We were

214
0:23:19,0000 --> 0:23:22,9890
there, the van was there. Did the  neighbours think, my God, she's

215
0:23:23,0000 --> 0:23:28,9890
back? The ones that remember it were  frightened. Jonathan Miller looked a

216
0:23:29,0000 --> 0:23:32,9890
bit... He looked a bit... Worried.  He wandered into the shop a couple

217
0:23:33,0000 --> 0:23:38,9890
of times. It's quite a starry  street. That's what they said, I

218
0:23:39,0000 --> 0:23:43,9890
didn't notice. I was in the van most  of the time. Jonathan Miller

219
0:23:44,0000 --> 0:23:47,9890
appeared once or twice looking a bit  fed up, which is not surprising

220
0:23:48,0000 --> 0:23:51,9890
because it was, you know, all that  stuff going on in your street is not

221
0:23:52,0000 --> 0:23:56,9890
amusing. You say you were in the  van, how much time did you spend in

222
0:23:57,0000 --> 0:23:59,9890
the van and how unpleasant does it  get? What was difficult, as you

223
0:24:00,0000 --> 0:24:05,9890
might think, was getting in and out  of it. And how the hell that woman

224
0:24:06,0000 --> 0:24:12,9890
did it. I mean... You just can't  imagine because it's the smallest

225
0:24:13,0000 --> 0:24:17,9890
space, isn't it? To think, we're  talking for a very long time. I

226
0:24:18,0000 --> 0:24:22,9890
don't want to go into it, but she  did everything there. She did. I'll

227
0:24:23,0000 --> 0:24:30,9890
go no further, but she did  everything. Over the course of the

228
0:24:31,0000 --> 0:24:36,9890
filming apparently, you were saying  Alex, the van was shared. Yes, we

229
0:24:37,0000 --> 0:24:40,9890
were filming in Alan's house, the  van was back in the street. It was

230
0:24:41,0000 --> 0:24:47,9890
disgusting, I mean, full of old bits  of vegetables. It was horrible. It

231
0:24:48,0000 --> 0:24:59,9890
was horrible. Sanitary ware  hanging... Don't! It wasn't mine, it

232
0:25:00,0000 --> 0:25:04,9890
was Miss Shepherd's. And there was  some kind of token security when we

233
0:25:05,0000 --> 0:25:08,9890
weren't filming there. Security came  in one morning, we were due to start

234
0:25:09,0000 --> 0:25:12,9890
shooting, I don't know, quite early  in the morning. And discovered four

235
0:25:13,0000 --> 0:25:18,9890
feet poking out of the end of the  van. Two Camden Town revellers had

236
0:25:19,0000 --> 0:25:25,9890
broken into the van and spent the  night in it. They got rid of them,

237
0:25:26,0000 --> 0:25:32,9890
cleans the van out of all this  stuff, cleaned it, put it back

238
0:25:33,0000 --> 0:25:39,9890
before she came on set. She. She.  And didn't tell Maggie. Everyone was

239
0:25:40,0000 --> 0:25:43,9890
sworn to secrecy, don't tell Maggie,  don't tell Maggie. What they thought

240
0:25:44,0000 --> 0:25:47,9890
I'd do I don't know, I was sorely  tempted to come like Miss Shepherd

241
0:25:48,0000 --> 0:25:54,9890
tonight. I have this horrible thing,  what should I wear? I feel haunted

242
0:25:55,0000 --> 0:26:02,9890
by her, she lived in Storrington  quite near where I live, I live in a

243
0:26:03,0000 --> 0:26:06,9890
village next door, little place. She  was in a nunnery because she was

244
0:26:07,0000 --> 0:26:10,9890
wanting... Don't know whether she  wanted to become a nun, but it was

245
0:26:11,0000 --> 0:26:16,9890
one of the ideas in the family, they  thought it was a good idea to do

246
0:26:17,0000 --> 0:26:20,9890
that. They used to be huge -- there  used to be a huge nunnery in

247
0:26:21,0000 --> 0:26:25,9890
Storrington. When I go in there,  which I do sometimes, I go to

248
0:26:26,0000 --> 0:26:29,9890
Waitrose and various things... I  always think, I wonder what it was

249
0:26:30,0000 --> 0:26:36,9890
like when she... When she was here,  you know, as a young person.

250
0:26:37,0000 --> 0:26:41,9890
It's... It's very odd playing a  person who is real, which is what

251
0:26:42,0000 --> 0:26:48,9890
you found, wasn't it? Alan Bennett  on one side, then even the fact they

252
0:26:49,0000 --> 0:26:51,9890
wouldn't tell you people were in the  van, it's intimidating when Dame

253
0:26:52,0000 --> 0:26:58,9890
Maggie Smith is on the set for you?  Not for you. LAUGHTER

254
0:26:59,0000 --> 0:27:05,9890
I pointed around you. It's not  intimidating, we've worked together.

255
0:27:06,0000 --> 0:27:11,9890
Liar! There was the odd moment. I  was much more intimidated because

256
0:27:12,0000 --> 0:27:18,9890
every single person on that set had  been at the National with Nick

257
0:27:19,0000 --> 0:27:21,9890
Hytner or in The History Boys. So I  was such an outsider you wouldn't

258
0:27:22,0000 --> 0:27:29,9890
believe. I really felt I ought to  audition. I really did. The play? I

259
0:27:30,0000 --> 0:27:38,9890
felt an outsider, you were very  cliquey. Were we? Yes, you were. And

260
0:27:39,0000 --> 0:27:47,9890
it made me feel very... Very  annoyed. So I don't know why you

261
0:27:48,0000 --> 0:27:51,9890
were intimidated. You do know what  it's like from the other side. I've

262
0:27:52,0000 --> 0:27:54,9890
read in interviews you talked about  how intimidating you found it

263
0:27:55,0000 --> 0:28:01,9890
when... In the 60s when you worked  with Laurence Olivier. Ooh! It

264
0:28:02,0000 --> 0:28:10,9890
sounds like he was very tough. Well,  yes, but I think everybody who

265
0:28:11,0000 --> 0:28:16,9890
worked with him... They were in all.  He hit me very hard one night.

266
0:28:17,0000 --> 0:28:26,9890
You're kidding? Onstage? Yes, he was  a bit cross with me. At one point he

267
0:28:27,0000 --> 0:28:31,9890
had to say, out, Devil! Dubai. He  slapped me, I hit the floor. I think

268
0:28:32,0000 --> 0:28:42,9890
it was Edward Petherbridge, a  Venetian gentleman, apparently, he

269
0:28:43,0000 --> 0:28:47,9890
said, ooh, Mags. I don't remember  because I literally went out. I

270
0:28:48,0000 --> 0:28:53,9890
remember saying, well, I did see  stars at the National Theatre. I

271
0:28:54,0000 --> 0:29:02,9890
really did. When you did Desdemona  to his fellow, you gave as good as

272
0:29:03,0000 --> 0:29:08,9890
you got? Yes. -- to his Othello.  This is when he was doing Othello

273
0:29:09,0000 --> 0:29:15,9890
and wearing all that make-up, all  that's... Are used to stick his

274
0:29:16,0000 --> 0:29:19,9890
eyelashes on for him. -- I used to.  Great big eyelashes. I went in one

275
0:29:20,0000 --> 0:29:26,9890
night, he said Darling Maggie, I've  been meaning to tell you, I think

276
0:29:27,0000 --> 0:29:31,9890
your vowels are not very good. Could  you watch it? Anyway, I went in the

277
0:29:32,0000 --> 0:29:39,9890
next night to do his eyelashes and  things and said, how now brown cow?

278
0:29:40,0000 --> 0:29:51,9890
He didn't get it.  You asked what it's like being with

279
0:29:52,0000 --> 0:30:00,9890
Maggie, it's working with the best,  because she is the best. Stop it.

280
0:30:01,0000 --> 0:30:05,9890
APPLAUSE. I know that's not true.  And before you film, before you go

281
0:30:06,0000 --> 0:30:13,9890
on stage, you are getting fantastic  nuggets about Noel Coward and

282
0:30:14,0000 --> 0:30:15,9890
Laurence Olivier or being taught  Polari by Kenneth Williams, and

283
0:30:16,0000 --> 0:30:19,9890
Bette Davis. She's really naughty.  You've had this

284
0:30:20,0000 --> 0:30:20,9890
extraordinary career.  You know, I mentioned the Oscars

285
0:30:21,0000 --> 0:30:23,9890
in the introduction and things.  That did sort of change your life

286
0:30:24,0000 --> 0:30:33,9890
in a way.  Well, yes,

287
0:30:34,0000 --> 0:30:37,9890
a lot of very small people kind  LAUGHTER. There's

288
0:30:38,0000 --> 0:30:47,9890
a whole different of people.  But also it's so weird they would

289
0:30:48,0000 --> 0:30:51,9890
only know you for that one thing.  Except one kid once said to me,

290
0:30:52,0000 --> 0:31:04,9890
he said, were you really a cat?  And I heard myself saying,

291
0:31:05,0000 --> 0:31:10,9890
just pull yourself together...  There's the Harry Potter bit of your

292
0:31:11,0000 --> 0:31:21,9890
life, which kind of changed your  Is that one of those things

293
0:31:22,0000 --> 0:31:32,9890
where you thought you were famous  It's only since Downton that people

294
0:31:33,0000 --> 0:31:49,9890
seem to know, you know,  It's only since Downton

295
0:31:50,0000 --> 0:31:52,9890
and that's television for you.  Funnily enough, I was in Waitrose

296
0:31:53,0000 --> 0:32:00,9890
in Storrington, my favourite.  And a little boy was

297
0:32:01,0000 --> 0:32:04,9890
at the checkout with his mother.  I thought,

298
0:32:05,0000 --> 0:32:10,9890
what am I going to do about it?  Kept looking at me and looking

299
0:32:11,0000 --> 0:32:14,9890
at me.  It's all right,

300
0:32:15,0000 --> 0:32:24,9890
it'll come to me in a minute.  The people coming up to you now,

301
0:32:25,0000 --> 0:32:38,9890
Americans, you know,  But I don't go anywhere, really,

302
0:32:39,0000 --> 0:32:48,9890
where they can get at me.  CHEERING Because it's usually

303
0:32:49,0000 --> 0:32:59,9890
in museums and art galleries  Are you in a way glad that Downton

304
0:33:00,0000 --> 0:33:09,9890
is over?  LAUGHTER No, because honestly,

305
0:33:10,0000 --> 0:33:17,9890
she was about, by the time we  Alex,

306
0:33:18,0000 --> 0:33:30,9890
I know you're a big Downton fan.  I do, yeah, we watch it and we

307
0:33:31,0000 --> 0:34:12,9890
shout at it because I'm not in it.  Have we got it on good authority

308
0:34:13,0000 --> 0:34:18,9890
that the actual Queen watches  Downton Abbey? We hear that she's a

309
0:34:19,0000 --> 0:34:24,9890
fan. You are not supposed to talk  about that. I was told that she did,

310
0:34:25,0000 --> 0:34:30,9890
but I have been told by another  gentleman who works this those

311
0:34:31,0000 --> 0:34:41,9890
establishments that she likes  Midsomer murder. Who doesn't? I

312
0:34:42,0000 --> 0:34:46,9890
didn't take it badly. Alan when it  isn't the first real person you

313
0:34:47,0000 --> 0:34:54,9890
played. You played Prince Charles. I  did, and one of the reviews said,

314
0:34:55,0000 --> 0:34:59,9890
why have they cast somebody who  looks like George Bush. You know

315
0:35:00,0000 --> 0:35:06,9890
Prince Charles don't you? I wouldn't  say I know him but he's patron of an

316
0:35:07,0000 --> 0:35:11,9890
actors charity I'm involved in.  You're in love with him, look at

317
0:35:12,0000 --> 0:35:20,9890
you! That's the funniest thing  anyone's ever said. Give me an OBE.

318
0:35:21,0000 --> 0:35:29,9890
Yes, he hasn't seen The Queen, I  know. For sure. I mean The Queen,

319
0:35:30,0000 --> 0:35:38,9890
the film. Has she seen it? But his  wife has. Did she like it? She did,

320
0:35:39,0000 --> 0:35:47,9890
she said, what was it like playing  my husband? Oh! She was quite

321
0:35:48,0000 --> 0:35:52,9890
twinkly. She is really very nice.  Clearly you are Dame Maggie Smith,

322
0:35:53,0000 --> 0:35:59,9890
we know that. I'm not that when I'm  working. Oh, so on a poster it says

323
0:36:00,0000 --> 0:36:11,9890
that? Yeah, because you don't use it  professionally. OK. Unless you're,

324
0:36:12,0000 --> 0:36:23,9890
who is it, Sir King Bens lie.  LAUGHTER. We must mention your other

325
0:36:24,0000 --> 0:36:35,9890
incredible honour, an elite group,  the Order of the Companions of

326
0:36:36,0000 --> 0:36:40,9890
Honour. That's a good hat isn't it?  Good hat, good shoes, good dress.

327
0:36:41,0000 --> 0:36:46,9890
How does that happen, how do you  join that elite group? It sort of

328
0:36:47,0000 --> 0:36:55,9890
happens when people die. You take  their place. I see! So there's a

329
0:36:56,0000 --> 0:36:59,9890
fixed number. There's a fixed  number, so... They just hang around

330
0:37:00,0000 --> 0:37:08,9890
a bit there'll be another vacancy.  LAUGHTER. It has been wonderful to

331
0:37:09,0000 --> 0:37:13,9890
meet you both. Please don't wait  another 42 years. There isn't time!

332
0:37:14,0000 --> 0:37:18,9890
We'll put it in the books now. OK.  The Lady In The Van is such a funny,

333
0:37:19,0000 --> 0:37:23,9890
sweet film. It opens on 13th  November. I urge you to see it.

334
0:37:24,0000 --> 0:37:34,9890
Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jennings  and Dame Maggie Smith!

335
0:37:35,0000 --> 0:37:41,9890
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. It is time  for our musical guest tonight. This

336
0:37:42,0000 --> 0:37:51,9890
man went from YouTube sensation to  bona fide superstar. Boosh boosh

337
0:37:52,0000 --> 0:38:02,9890
boosh please welcome Mr Justin  Bieber.

338
0:38:03,0000 --> 0:38:08,9890
# When you nod your head yes  # But you wanna say no

339
0:38:09,0000 --> 0:38:16,9890
# When you don't want me to move  # But you tell me to go

340
0:38:17,0000 --> 0:38:23,9890
# What do you mean?  # Oh, what do you mean?

341
0:38:24,0000 --> 0:38:30,9890
# What do you mean?  # Oh-oh-oh, what do you mean?

342
0:38:31,0000 --> 0:38:38,9890
# You're so indecisive is what I'm  saying

343
0:38:39,0000 --> 0:38:46,9890
# Don't know if you're happy or  complaining

344
0:38:47,0000 --> 0:38:53,9890
# First you wanna go to the left  # Then you turn right

345
0:38:54,0000 --> 0:38:57,9890
# Wanna argue all day  # Making love all night

346
0:38:58,0000 --> 0:39:01,9890
# First you're up then you're down  # And then in between

347
0:39:02,0000 --> 0:39:10,9890
# When you nod your head yes  # But you wanna say no

348
0:39:11,0000 --> 0:39:20,9890

349
0:39:21,0000 --> 0:39:24,9890
# What do you mean?  # Oh, what do you mean?

350
0:39:25,0000 --> 0:39:39,9890
# You're overprotective when I'm  leaving

351
0:39:40,0000 --> 0:39:43,9890
# Trying to compromise, but I can't  win

352
0:39:44,0000 --> 0:39:47,9890
# You wanna make a point but you  keep preaching

353
0:39:48,0000 --> 0:39:54,9890
# First you wanna go to the left  # Then you turn right

354
0:39:55,0000 --> 0:39:58,9890
# Wanna argue all day, make love all  night

355

359
0:40:26,0000 --> 0:40:28,9890
# Said you're running out of time  # What do you mean?

360
0:40:29,0000 --> 0:40:54,9890

362
0:41:05,0000 --> 0:41:11,9890
# Better make up your mind  # What do you mean? #

363
0:41:12,0000 --> 0:41:22,9890
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Mr Justin  Bieber everybody. Thank you very

364
0:41:23,0000 --> 0:41:28,9890
much. That was fantastic. Thank you  for doing that. Congratulations.

365
0:41:29,0000 --> 0:41:34,9890
It's number one everywhere isn't it?  Yeah, it is. It must be a relief. It

366
0:41:35,0000 --> 0:41:39,9890
is. You bring out new material... It  is good to have people accept the

367
0:41:40,0000 --> 0:41:43,9890
music and not be about my personal  life. That's why I started in the

368
0:41:44,0000 --> 0:41:48,9890
first place. It feels really good,  because I'm growing up and my music

369
0:41:49,0000 --> 0:41:52,9890
is growing up. It's fun. And you're  out here busting a move. Obviously

370
0:41:53,0000 --> 0:41:57,9890
the voice is why we know you. Is  that easy for you, the dancing

371
0:41:58,0000 --> 0:42:02,9890
stuff? What's hard is singing and  dancing and trying to breathe at the

372
0:42:03,0000 --> 0:42:06,9890
same time. I'm forgetting to breathe  because I'm so conscious of the

373
0:42:07,0000 --> 0:42:14,9890
moves and my voice, but I'm getting  better at it. Good, we don't want to

374
0:42:15,0000 --> 0:42:19,9890
lose you on my watch. That song,  what do you mean, it's a cry from

375
0:42:20,0000 --> 0:42:25,9890
the heart to the women of the world.  I never know what they mean. All

376
0:42:26,0000 --> 0:42:31,9890
boys don't know what girls mean.  That's why we needed an anthem. Boys

377
0:42:32,0000 --> 0:42:36,9890
walking down the street, what do you  mean? Next time you're in an

378
0:42:37,0000 --> 0:42:41,9890
argument, say, what do you mean?  That's the thing about boys, you

379
0:42:42,0000 --> 0:42:45,9890
know exactly what you mean. New  album, Purpose, is out November

380
0:42:46,0000 --> 0:42:50,9890
13th. Yep. Very good. Thank you. No,  it is. Presumably you will tour with

381
0:42:51,0000 --> 0:42:56,9890
this? I'm coming back to London to  tour here as well. Please come and

382
0:42:57,0000 --> 0:43:04,9890
see us again, Justin. We love having  you here. Thank you.

383
0:43:05,0000 --> 0:43:16,9890
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. No time for  the red chair tonight. Just time to

384
0:43:17,0000 --> 0:43:22,9890
say thanks to Justin Bieber, Alex  Jennings, Bradley Cooper and Dame

385
0:43:23,0000 --> 0:43:24,9890
Maggie Smith. Next week it is Julie  Walters and Michael Fassbender. I

386
0:43:25,0000 --> 0:43:30,0000
will see you then. Goodbye!
