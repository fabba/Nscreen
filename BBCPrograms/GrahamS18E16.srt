00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,360
On tonight's show, we're keeping up with the Joneses,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,160
lovely couple, the amazing Mr Smith and the gorgeous Mr Reynolds.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,320
All the big names are here, let's start the show!

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,840
CHEERING

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,240
This programme contains strong language.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Oh! Oh!

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
Oh! Oh!

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,960
Good evening, everybody!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
You all in a good mood? Yes!

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,240
It's Friday night, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, it is!

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,160
Woohoo, I tell you.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
Some great names on my sofa tonight. I feel so lucky.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,920
I feel luckier than a 48-year-old granny

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,960
who's left her lottery ticket in the washing machine.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,880
You can't blame a granny for trying, can you?

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,560
Did anyone see the nude picture?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
Release the balls!

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
LAUGHTER

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,880
Let's get our guests on.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,040
Later, we'll have music from our good friend,

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
the extraordinary Laura Mvula.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
But, first, he is one of our finest character actors,

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,040
who is leading the charge as Captain Mainwaring

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,240
in the new Dad's Army film.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,520
It's Toby Jones, ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,600
Hello, sir. Very nice to see you.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,160
Have a seat, do.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,360
Toby Jones.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,160
This lady went from the Welsh Valleys

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,440
to the Hollywood Hills,

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,160
and won an Oscar for her standout performance in Chicago.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,200
Please welcome the fabulous Catherine Zeta-Jones!

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,880
Wowzer!

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
Wow! You look fabulous, darling!

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,640
Come in and sit down.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,760
Catherine Zeta-Jones!

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,040
It's really her.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,560
He's one of Hollywood's hottest leading men,

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,680
now he is turning the superhero genre on its head in Deadpool.

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,240
Please welcome, for the first time, Ryan Reynolds, everybody!

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Ryan Reynolds! Hello!

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,160
Very nice to see you. Come in. Sit down.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
That's Ryan Reynolds.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,160
And... And...

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,360
He's not just one of my favourite guests,

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,880
he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world,

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,120
from West Philadelphia, born and raised,

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,320
it's a warm welcome back to Will Smith!

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Oh!

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
So good to see you.

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,120
Hello, hello, hello.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
Sit down.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,720
- Hey!
- Oh, man.

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,200
I tell you, not a bad haul.

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Not a bad haul, ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
Very cool.

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,320
Ooh, but actually, very quickly, before we say another thing,

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,360
I should just say, if you are a Zayn Malik fan,

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,280
I am really sorry...

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
and he's not here!

65
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,320
LAUGHTER

66
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm out of here!

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
- You were upset. Ryan was upset. 
- I was.

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
I saw with your tweet.

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
You were hurt.

70
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,800
Zayn Malik is really making me regret

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,600
this Zayn Malik tattoo I have on my back.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,040
He's making it difficult.

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,400
Ryan tweeted when he heard the news of the cancellation...

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,640
LAUGHTER

75
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
True story. True story.

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
- Maybe not for nothing. 
- Maybe not for nothing.

77
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,520
- Hello! 
- Anyway, we don't know where he is.

78
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,480
But, hey, lovely to see you all.

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,200
This is special, ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,960
In the world of show business, we don't often get to say this,

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,720
four happily married people on the couch.

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,760
Not to each other! The Joneses not related in any way.

83
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,440
I need to make an announcement before we...

84
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
LAUGHTER

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,800
That would be so weird, if down the sofa...

86
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,960
Anyway!

87
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,280
Totes awks.

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
So, Ryan, you and Blake have been married for...?

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh, God. Don't do this to me.

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
Two...uh...four years.

91
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
- Three years!
- Are you guessing?

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,920
(Three-and-a-half!)

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,280
Yeah, three-and-a-half, you just go, you know...

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,400
OK, good luck with getting to four!

95
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,360
LAUGHTER

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,640
And Catherine and Michael, you have been together a long time now.

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,920
15. Together 17, married 15.

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,000
- How do you know that?! 
- Will and Jada?

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,880
Together 22, married 18.

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Very good.

101
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,080
But Toby and Karen beat you all.

102
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,560
Together 26, married 1.

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Wow!

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
What happened there?

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
LAUGHTER

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
Like, were you saving?

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,520
- "I want it to be really nice."
- I have to be very careful what I say.

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
- No, What happened?
- Well... 
- Sorry, this is none of my business!

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,960
It's just interesting.

110
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,000
We proposed and accepted about three or four times.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,880
Every time I proposed once,

112
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,240
"Yeah, let's do that, let's do that." Then...

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,760
"Yeah, we'll do that..."

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,080
And then the next time nothing happened,

115
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,280
and the next time she proposed on a leap year.

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,680
I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,640
Nothing happened...

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,240
And then the third time, I proposed again, nothing happened.

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,720
Then we said we've got to stop proposing.

120
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,040
We couldn't really agree on how to do it.

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,760
We knew how to do it, obviously,

122
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
but didn't agree how to do it, as it were.

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,960
We're still talking about getting married now?

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
- Yes.
- Yes, OK. LAUGHTER

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
He's obviously good at proposing.

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Proposing? Yeah, they've got that down!

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,840
He proposed the hell out of that woman!

128
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,400
You finally got there?

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,160
After 25 years, it seemed like a good thing to do.

130
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
Very good.

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
Of course, Ryan, married to beautiful Blake,

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,320
the sexiest man in the world.

133
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,160
She is the sexiest man in the world!

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
You've done well there.

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
That's a good shot right there.

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
- Look at you.
- Beautiful and happy.

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
So annoying!

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
Sorry about that, yeah.

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
No, but to cheer us up,

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,560
when you started kind of being interested in girls,

141
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,840
you weren't that cool or smooth with it.

142
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
- No! No, not at all. 
- I don't believe it.

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
No, I really...

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,760
I went through puberty at, like, 27.

145
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
LAUGHTER

146
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,120
It was a freak thing. It was not good.

147
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,320
- The voice changing. 
- Who was the girl in school?

148
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,680
The first girl?

149
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,640
- I was obsessed with this girl, Fiona Gorchinski, who...
- Mm!

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,200
She used to actually take the bus the opposite way of my actual home.

151
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
I would get on the bus just to sit next to her

152
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,280
for 45 minutes the wrong way.

153
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,080
There is something wonderful about that.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,320
- Yeah...
- And moronic.

155
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,800
LAUGHTER

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,720
I love it - when you're young it's so cute,

157
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,160
when you're older, it's just stalking.

158
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,720
You're, like, on some kind of watch list.

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,040
But I remember, I couldn't have been more than,

160
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,400
I don't know, 11 years old.

161
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
I was just about to get off the bus, cos enough is enough,

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,080
I'm about to enter, like, Seattle or something.

163
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm starting to get off the bus.

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,160
I decided to kind of hit her with this cool look or something.

165
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Like one of these real, like, Don Johnson, Miami Vice things.

166
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
Let me feel it. Let me feel it.

167
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,160
- Yeah, you feel that? 
- I threw up in my mouth a bit.

168
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,240
I do this move as I'm getting down off the bus

169
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,280
and I sort of delay a little too long

170
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,920
and the bus doors close on my backpack.

171
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
On my backpack.

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
The bus just starts to leave...

173
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
LAUGHTER

174
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,920
I'm sort of doing this dance, like...

175
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm banging on the side of the bus.

176
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,200
The bus driver finally stops, opens the door,

177
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,160
releases my idiot backpack,

178
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,880
and I could never look at her again.

179
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
- Aw!
- It was terrible.

180
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,680
- Well, she's looking at you now. 
- Yeah, she sure is.

181
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
LAUGHTER

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Can you imagine? "He's the guy with the backpack?!"

183
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,960
"He's the idiot with the Ren And Stimpy backpack."

184
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael, obviously been married...

185
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
- 15.
- ..15 years.

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Couples, when they've been together a long time,

187
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,640
they have rituals and ways to keep the relationship fresh,

188
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,960
but you have one involving golf. Is this right?

189
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,880
Yeah, that old thing.

190
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
- I'm pretty good. 
- I don't think I can handle this.

191
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,720
- I can...kick his ass in golf, if I say so.
- Wow!

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
Don't you make these bets when you're playing golf?

193
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,360
Yeah, if he duffs a shot and can't get his ball

194
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,000
over the lady's tee, he has to take his pants off.

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
He will drop them.

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,640
- TOBY:
- On the pitch? 
- On the pitch?!

197
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,280
LAUGHTER

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,040
You're worse than I am! Even I know that!

199
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,960
- On the course!
- On the course, yes.

200
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
It's pitch and putt!

201
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,360
Crazy golf.

202
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,400
- Well, expose himself in some way. 
- And does he do it?!

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,880
But it's not just my husband, it's any man I play with.

204
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,920
LAUGHTER

205
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,720
APPLAUSE

206
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,280
I have questions too.

207
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,440
He doesn't have a question, he was volunteering to play golf!

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,880
Drop them on the course? What are the paparazzi doing all day?!

209
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
There has been an issue with paparazzi,

210
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
but I made him go into the bushes and drop his pants.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
A deal is a deal.

212
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Will, you and Jada, you are kind of a real Hollywood couple,

213
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,080
power couple now, married 18 years.

214
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,880
That is my wife.

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Still interested, look at that!

216
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,440
LAUGHTER

217
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,920
Are you looking at her boobs?

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
That is not a good... That picture - why did you do that?

219
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm looking at her like food!

220
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,040
I'm looking like I'm still breast-feeding!

221
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,720
Jeez!

222
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
It's a good thing that's my wife!

223
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Just before we move on, I must, of course, say to you, Will,

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,600
cos it's been a weird year because of the Oscars

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
and all the controversy and everything.

226
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,520
It must be odd for you talking about it,

227
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,440
because you are kind of part of it.

228
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,960
People are talking about your performance, that movie,

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,480
so where are you officially now, where are you standing?

230
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
The thing that is most important for me

231
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,600
is that the spirit of it has to maintain.

232
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,680
The media creates the us and them.

233
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,360
For me, there is no us and them, it's we.

234
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,080
I'm a member of the Academy.

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,480
I felt very seriously that there is a sort of a...

236
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,600
kind of a regression in America in general,

237
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,400
a regression towards separatism and racial and religious exclusion.

238
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,160
So, for me, it is more about putting my hand up

239
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
and reminding my community, the Hollywood community,

240
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
that we have to lead.

241
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,080
Diversity is America's superpower.

242
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,640
That is what makes our country great.

243
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
It is really important.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,240
In Hollywood, we've got to be pushing forward,

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,400
even in a time of a wider regression.

246
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,640
- Well, hopefully something good comes out of it.
- It always does.

247
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,800
As my grandmother says, that's the only thing that can come out of it,

248
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
if you lead with love and light,

249
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,120
good is only going to come out of it.

250
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
Wise man!

251
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,600
Wise man, Will Smith.

252
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
APPLAUSE

253
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
Right, Will Smith, ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
you are here with a film - Concussion.

255
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,160
It tells an extraordinary true story.

256
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,920
Was this story well-known in America?

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,280
Cos it wasn't well-known here.

258
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,840
You know, it wasn't really well-known in America at the time.

259
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Since I took the film, it has been really well-known.

260
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,400
But it's the story of essentially there's a brain disease

261
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,600
that American football players...

262
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,400
It's actually expanded beyond American football players -

263
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,240
rugby, and the Australian rules and soccer, even -

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,840
but this is the doctor who discovered the brain disease

265
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
that the players are getting.

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,560
- It opens here on... 
- It's a big comedy!

267
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
It is a terrific story.

268
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
It opens here on the 12th of February.

269
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,120
I think often in this country if we hear a movie

270
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,480
is about American football or baseball or something,

271
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
we think we won't get it.

272
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
But this is really accessible because it is told from the doctor

273
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,040
who also doesn't know about football.

274
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,080
Absolutely, yeah. The doctor, he was a Nigerian immigrant.

275
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,840
He came and he discovered the disease.

276
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
He's a forensic pathologist.

277
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,520
So I had to see autopsies to prepare for this role.

278
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,480
- Oh!
- Yeah.

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Don't go to autopsies.

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
LAUGHTER

281
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,480
That's as a general rule. As a general rule. If somebody,

282
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,200
"Hey, man, we're going to an autopsy tomorrow", just don't go.

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,040
It was definitely a jarring experience.

284
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Yes.

285
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,120
- TOBY:
- Is there no solution to the problem?

286
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,720
What it is, is that for American football,

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,280
the helmet actually presents a greater problem.

288
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,880
Your brain is completely disconnected from the skull,

289
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,440
sitting in a fluid.

290
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,160
So in the film, we use the illustration

291
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,160
of an onion inside of a jar.

292
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,200
It is just free flowing. There is nothing you can do.

293
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,560
You can put an exoskeleton over it, you put the helmet over it,

294
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,640
but you still don't stop the onion from hitting inside,

295
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,160
and that's what happens to the human brain.

296
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,360
Also it's a multibillion dollar industry.

297
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
It's a very difficult thing to stop.

298
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,720
Toby, you should not play American football!

299
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
LAUGHTER

300
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,080
Just give that dream up, Toby!

301
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
Just give it up, give it up.

302
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,680
You can't take a man's dream like that!

303
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
We've got a clip. This is you as Dr Bennet Omalu pleading

304
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
with a representative from the governing body of football, the NFL.

305
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,720
Sir, I am not done.

306
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
History laughs.

307
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,800
If you continue to deny my work,

308
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,680
the world will deny my work.

309
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,520
But men, your men...

310
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,040
continue to die, their families left in ruins.

311
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
Tell the truth.

312
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,320
Tell the truth.

313
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,320
Are you sure you want to do this?

314
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I would ask you that same question.

315
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,040
Powerful stuff.

316
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,440
Dr Omalu, he loves that this film has been made,

317
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,920
he loves that he is now you.

318
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,400
Oh, yeah, look at that.

319
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,000
That's what his face looks like all the time.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,640
He is so completely happy. All the things that he suffered.

321
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,800
It's funny, he sent me a link.

322
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,200
There was a Nigerian comedian that was talking about my performance

323
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,600
in the movie, and he said...

324
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,680
- NIGERIAN ACCENT:
- "Will Smith is doing a Nigerian accent in his film,

325
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,960
"and the haters will say that it is no good,

326
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
"but I think that is not true.

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,280
"I think he sounds like a Nigerian with a concussion."

328
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,240
LAUGHTER

329
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,240
That's about the best compliment they can pay.

330
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,920
Four actors, you all have to do accents,

331
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,160
but, Ryan, we don't think of Canadians as having accents,

332
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
- and yet you...
- Oh, we do.

333
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,320
You've lost your accent, you would say?

334
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
Yeah, I sort of trained myself out of it.

335
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,880
But, you know, I go back home and it pops up again.

336
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,080
That's all Ottawa. I hear that's all Ottawa. I can hear it.

337
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,200
Oh, yeah, it gets that. Mm!

338
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,880
Say "about".

339
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
Well, in Canada it is "aboot".

340
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,120
That's what I'm saying. Say it the way you say it.

341
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,080
What are you talking aboot? What are you talking aboot? But...

342
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,480
It's a bad word, I'm sorry.

343
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,240
You handle everything with, "Oh, fuck, buddy."

344
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,480
Is it something about the Canadian accent

345
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,040
that makes you a really bad liar?

346
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,800
Well, yeah, we are not good at lying or fighting, really.

347
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,040
- That's good.
- It's all slappy, it's not very sexy.

348
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,160
Weren't you caught at the border...?

349
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,320
Yeah. My wife is a foodie, and she loves these apple pies they make

350
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,640
at this place in Vancouver, where I grew up.

351
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,400
We grabbed a bunch of them and headed...

352
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,040
We were driving back down to the States, we crossed the border.

353
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
You're not allowed to cross the border with vegetables,

354
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
- it is illegal.
- Yeah, it's illegal.

355
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
This guy knew something was going on.

356
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
- We get up to the border crossing... 
- TOBY:
- Pie smugglers.

357
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah, pie smugglers. I'm an actor.

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,520
Most Hollywood actors, they have a kilo of cocaine in their car!

359
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,600
I've just got pies.

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,800
But he knew something was going on, right?

361
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
- You had the pie face. 
- I totally had the pie face.

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,200
I've got the worst poker face... Worst pie face ever.

363
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
And, yeah...

364
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,240
And he says... And my voice always gets really high when I'm lying.

365
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
He said, "Have you got anything? Any fruit, any vegetables?"

366
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
- And I was like... 
- HIGH-PITCHED TONE:
- No!

367
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,760
- HIGH-PITCHED TONE:
- Why the hell would I have fruits and vegetables, man?

368
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,960
- HIGH-PITCHED TONE:
- Crazy!

369
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,280
- HIGH-PITCHED TONE:
- Who would bring fruits and vegetables?

370
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,200
Basically, he just had me on the hook.

371
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,640
He looked at me and goes, "You remember that movie you did,

372
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,960
"that movie, Just Friends?" I was like, "Yeah, yeah."

373
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,920
He said, "You know that song at the end of it

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,320
"where you sing I Swear by All-4-One?" "Yeah, yeah."

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,880
He was like, "Go ahead."

376
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,520
LAUGHTER No!

377
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,080
Basically, he was saying, "Dance, monkey."

378
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,040
- I bet you danced.
- I danced.

379
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,400
I sang that thing in the best falsetto I had

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,040
and I was on my way through the border eating pie by the next stop.

381
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,200
Catherine Zeta-Jones, you, famously for us, you are from Wales.

382
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,440
From Wales!

383
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,400
There's loads of roles for Welsh girls around.

384
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Finally!

385
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
After Mask Of Zorro...

386
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,920
Oh, they thought I was Spanish.

387
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,560
Yeah, I had to go to the red carpet and everyone would go, "Hola".

388
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,000
All I said was, "Gracias, gracias."

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,360
They could have been saying anything about me.

390
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,560
"Gracias. Muy bien. Muchas gracias."

391
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,240
- To me, you still have a Welsh accent.
- Yeah.

392
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,800
But is that because you are here?

393
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,560
I've been with my mam and dad this whole weekend and my brother,

394
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,120
and it gets stronger.

395
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,520
When I first met Michael, I'd be on the phone to my mother,

396
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
and I'd get off the phone and he'd say,

397
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
"Oh, it's a beautiful language, Welsh." I went...

398
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,560
- EXAGGERATED ACCENT:
- "What are you talking about?

399
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,240
- "I'm speaking English." 
- LAUGHTER

400
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,920
I have to say, the night you won the BAFTA,

401
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,080
you were suddenly the Welsh-est woman alive.

402
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,160
I know!

403
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,000
It's that humble thing that comes on.

404
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,880
- EXAGGERATED ACCENT:
- "I'm from Swansea, I don't deserve this!"

405
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
Because you must have had friends there,

406
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,040
American friends in the audience

407
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
who mustn't have known what you were doing.

408
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,680
You did the big chant and everything.

409
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,840
I did "Oggy Oggy", didn't I?

410
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,800
I think Wales won that day, actually.

411
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
Was that what it was?

412
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,920
Something that jogged my memory

413
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,640
about how important "Oggy Oggy" was in my life.

414
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,840
These two are smiling and nodding.

415
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,040
Oggy oggy. Oggy oggy.

416
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,560
If I did the "Oggy Oggy", you'd know what to do, right?

417
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,600
- To show the Americans. 
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

418
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,640
All right. Ready?

419
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,680
Oggy oggy oggy.

420
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,320
Oi! Oi! Oi!

421
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
Oggy oggy oggy!

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Oi! Oi! Oi!

423
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
- Oggy!
- Oi!

424
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,000
- Oggy!
- Oi!

425
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,240
Oggy oggy oggy!

426
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,680
Oi! Oi! Oi!

427
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
Now you can do it.

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,640
- I'm going to take that home. 
- Yeah, we're going to take that back.

429
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
Ours is more like...

430
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,240
Say ho-ohh.

431
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
Ho-ohh!

432
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,880
It's really simple.

433
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,840
In Canada it's...

434
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
"Sorry about that".

435
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
LAUGHTER

436
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,480
APPLAUSE

437
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,440
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, Ryan Reynolds brings us Deadpool.

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

439
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
I love that poster.

440
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,880
That poster tells you everything you need to know about this movie.

441
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
That is a really good poster.

442
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,040
A man in a very tight red body suit.

443
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,480
It opens here on February 10th.

444
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,440
This must feel great for you.

445
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,240
This has been a labour of love, getting this made.

446
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,360
Yes, yeah.

447
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,760
It's been the best and worst relationship I've ever been in.

448
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,160
11 years. 11 years I've been trying to get this movie made.

449
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,400
We wrote a script, we did that about six years ago.

450
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,160
Then we did a little bit of test footage for this movie.

451
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,880
That test footage sat on a shelf at Fox for four years.

452
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,280
Then about a year and a half ago,

453
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,000
somebody accidentally leaked it on the internet.

454
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,760
- (Was that you?)
- Super crazy.

455
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,160
Oh, no. It had nothing to do with me.

456
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
I had nothing to do with that.

457
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Very un-Canadian of you.

458
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,120
My mum was like, "What does this button do?

459
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,760
"Ah!"

460
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,440
"Oh, well, I guess we're making the movie now."

461
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,400
It just went nuts. People started writing and flooding Fox,

462
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
begging and pleading for the Deadpool movie to get made.

463
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,320
Within 24 hours, we had a green light.

464
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,600
- It was that quick? 
- It was that quick.

465
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
It was so undeniable, and it felt really good.

466
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,920
Also, you must be quite pissed off

467
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,360
that you couldn't make that decision for yourselves.

468
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,040
Exactly, we tried and tried, but the fans got it made.

469
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,960
It's a great story too, this is totally fan-driven in every way.

470
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,920
People who don't know, they'll be thinking,

471
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,760
"Why wouldn't the studio want to make this? It's a superhero movie.

472
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,240
"Everyone loves them." And it is a superhero movie

473
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,440
and it's got all those things, but it does also have

474
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
this kind of indie movie sensibility and edginess.

475
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,960
It is meta. The character knows he's in a comic book movie,

476
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
but he works in the X-Men universe,

477
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,160
so he's dealing with other X-Men, he's talking about other X-Men.

478
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,560
He's making jokes about Ryan Reynolds.

479
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,160
It is rated R, which is unusual for a Marvel, X-Men type movie.

480
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,760
I think it's a certificate 15 here in the UK.

481
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah, we can take it.

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,680
LAUGHTER

483
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
In China it's rated go fuck yourself!

484
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,800
- Basically, they're not showing it there at all.
- Washed their hands!

485
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
It's sad, I wish we could show it there.

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,320
But, yeah, it's a pretty unorthodox film.

487
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,920
Also, what's great is to reflect, like that poster,

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,520
but also you've done other posters that are unorthodox.

489
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,640
The marketing of this movie has been so much fun.

490
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,200
Are you involved in these things?

491
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,520
Completely. We love it.

492
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,880
We're, like, giddily texting and e-mailing each other

493
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,760
in the middle of the night. "What if we tried this?"

494
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,160
The emoji poster, I love the emoji poster.

495
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
- Deadpool.
- Deadpool... Ha!

496
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
Dead - poo - L.

497
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
That just started as a jokey text message

498
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,920
between me and a couple other people.

499
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,480
Then the Fox marketing guys said,

500
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
"We're going to make that into a billboard."

501
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
I said, "You don't have the balls." And there it is.

502
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,520
Also, you haven't forgotten that it's opening on Valentine's weekend.

503
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,720
Of course, yeah.

504
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,760
So we've got that.

505
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
True love never dies.

506
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
There are references to Valentine's Day in it.

507
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,880
It is. There is a big love story in this film.

508
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,520
The love story quickly turns into dick-kicking revenge,

509
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,080
but, still, it's a love story.

510
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,920
I like how it shocks me, cos on American TV

511
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,280
you can't say stuff like that.

512
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,160
No, you can't say it here either.

513
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,640
LAUGHTER

514
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,520
I'll just be saying "Hi" on the couch when it airs.

515
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,680
I'll just say, "Deadpool!"

516
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,560
Then I'll go, "On to Dad's Army."

517
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,840
Also, you didn't just work on the things,

518
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
you did the voice-overs for some trailers.

519
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,360
Yeah, I did.

520
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,040
Exactly, yeah. I love that stuff.

521
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
I do it at home all the time. It drives my wife nuts.

522
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
You know, it's that voice...

523
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,480
- DEEP AND GRAVELLY TONE:
- In a world divided by fear,

524
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
one man must stand alone.

525
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,680
Will Smith, Ryan Reynolds,

526
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,480
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Toby Jones,

527
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
in...Graham Norton's Pants, rated R.

528
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,600
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

529
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
That's my ringtone.

530
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,320
That was really good.

531
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
Like Don LaFontaine. That guy's the best.

532
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,280
- Yeah, the trailer guy. 
- I want to see that movie!

533
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,800
Listen, we've got a clip from Deadpool.

534
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,960
This is essentially...

535
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,440
This is you and your crew, a couple of the other X people,

536
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
- confronting your nemesis.
- Yes!

537
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,120
MUSIC: X Gon' Give It To Ya by DMX

538
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,880
Go get some.

539
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,760
She's going to do a superhero landing. Wait for it!

540
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,840
Whoo!

541
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,520
Superhero landing!

542
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,640
You know, that's really hard on your knees.

543
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Totally impractical. They all do it.

544
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,760
You are a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Frances.

545
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,480
That's why I brought him!

546
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,680
I prefer not to hit a woman, so please...

547
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,240
METALLIC CLANG

548
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,720
I mean...that's why I brought her?

549
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,400
Oh, no, finish your tweet.

550
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,040
Just give us a second.

551
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,680
There you go, hashtag it.

552
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,160
Go get her, tiger.

553
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,480
I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.

554
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,160
LAUGHTER

555
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
You don't think about it watching the movie,

556
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,520
but there is a weird thing -

557
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,400
is it true the director based some of the fight moves on Muhammad Ali?

558
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,840
Some of the big fight scenes, yeah.

559
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
Sorry.

560
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,640
We've got the other Muhammad Ali right here.

561
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,920
Some of it was based on Muhammad Ali -

562
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,000
just that idea of how he sort of got in people's heads.

563
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,600
He was punching them in the brain

564
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,880
as much as he was punching them in the face.

565
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,160
A lot of it is that, that sort of floating thing that he does,

566
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,160
it's a psychological warfare as well.

567
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,920
Because when you were preparing to play Muhammad Ali,

568
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,160
watching tapes, how many hours did you spend watching tapes?

569
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,640
What I used to do was

570
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,960
there was a way that his arm moved, and Michael Mann, the director,

571
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,040
wanted me to burn neural passages.

572
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,720
So I would sit in a dark room for 20 minutes at a time,

573
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,000
but for two or three hours a day,

574
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
just in a dark room and I would watch a loop of him doing the jab,

575
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,760
- doing the jab, doing the jab. 
- Whoa, wow.

576
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,840
- Trying to burn neural passages. 
- Yeah.

577
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,080
It didn't work.

578
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,360
It was a bad idea from the beginning.

579
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,160
The movie was great, something worked.

580
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,920
Toby Jones, you've been in some big superhero movies.

581
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,680
Oh, I thought you were going to say as Captain Mainwaring,

582
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,560
did I burn some neural passages?

583
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
I wasn't asked to do that.

584
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,440
No, you were in Captain America and Hunger Games, you were in that.

585
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,400
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Did you get to do stunts?

586
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,440
No, I get to watch people do stunts.

587
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,920
I contrived special powers, because in the Marvel stuff,

588
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,640
I'm Arnim Zola, a sort of German nefarious doctor, evil doctor.

589
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,040
Ooh.

590
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm against Captain America.

591
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,480
- We may run into each other in the future.
- Oh, good.

592
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,760
But at the moment I'm just preoccupied with Captain America,

593
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,960
dealing with him.

594
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,040
Is it extraordinary for you now when parents tell their children

595
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,760
that you are Dobby from Harry Potter?

596
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,160
Well, it is, because I think they look at me

597
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,360
and think, "Well, he's not that big,

598
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,600
"maybe he could fit into a costume as Dobby... Around his eyes..."

599
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,560
There's always a slight moment of assessing whether I'm tall enough.

600
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,920
And then I say I'm only partly responsible, just for the voice.

601
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Then there's always the kind of, "Can you do the voice on the phone?

602
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,520
"Can you speak to my mother?"

603
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,640
Apparently being Dobby brings with it

604
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
its own sort of fan mail.

605
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,920
Yes.

606
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,000
There is a certain kind of fan of Dobby, you think,

607
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
"Well, you're not really a child.

608
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,000
"You are an adult and you are asking me to write a little legend

609
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,480
"for your partner, in which you say

610
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,880
"you've been a really, really bad Dobby."

611
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,960
As you know, Dobby gets hit around.

612
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Taken in the wrong context it could be implications of sadomasochism.

613
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,480
Yes. We never imagined Harry Potter would go there.

614
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,640
It's very dark, Toby.

615
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
Hey, man, I only sent that letter because I appreciate it.

616
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
LAUGHTER

617
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,320
Can I get your e-mail?

618
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,800
Very quickly, I am so sorry there won't be more Hunger Games.

619
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,120
This character... This character deserves a spin-off.

620
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

621
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
That's...

622
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
That's its...

623
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,120
That's its own movie.

624
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,640
- That is an amazing... 
- Who is that guy?

625
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,200
It looks like my aunt Kathy.

626
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,640
Yeah, she's not sending you a card now.

627
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,280
Catherine Zeta-Jones, you've done extraordinary stunt work.

628
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,000
You did a lot of the sword stuff in Mask Of Zorro?

629
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,080
A lot of the sword stuff in Zorro, yeah.

630
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,120
But I think probably my biggest stunt

631
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,960
was getting my ass through lasers in Entrapment.

632
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,600
Mm-hmm! I remember that.

633
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Did you have to be able to do that?

634
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,520
LAUGHTER

635
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm sorry, was that my external voice?!

636
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,240
We used to watch that trailer a lot.

637
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,800
I remember that scene.

638
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,120
I remember that scene. I was by myself...

639
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,200
- TOBY:
- That's burnt onto a neural passage.

640
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,000
- Yes, that one worked.
- Yeah, exactly!

641
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
APPLAUSE

642
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,000
Now, Dad's Army hits the big screens next Friday

643
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
with Catherine and Toby.

644
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,520
Toby, for you, taking on Captain Mainwaring,

645
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,280
I mean, Arthur Lowe is so loved and it's still on telly all the time.

646
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,760
- Yeah, every Saturday.
- How daunting?

647
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,400
It was 100% daunting.

648
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,640
It was something that I thought very, very carefully about it.

649
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,840
Then I saw the script.

650
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,760
I suppose, more importantly, it was seeing the other actors involved.

651
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,000
When you think, "Oh, I can't play that part,

652
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,840
"I loved Arthur Lowe doing it", then I saw the kind of actors

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,120
they were getting involved with the script,

654
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
and then Catherine came on board.

655
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,640
It became un-turn-down-able.

656
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,600
It became a selfish decision, it just looked so much fun to do.

657
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,040
Sometimes with a job, in the end, I just want to do

658
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,520
those stupid things with those great actors.

659
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,240
That's what makes it... Cos I think everyone was nervous,

660
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,440
but then when you saw the cast, you were like, "Hang on."

661
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,080
Yeah, I want to be in that gang.

662
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
I want to hang with you guys for a while.

663
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
Less pressure for you, I guess, Catherine,

664
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
- because your character is new. 
- Yeah, completely new.

665
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,400
I get thrown into Walmington-on-Sea.

666
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm a journalist doing an article on the Home Guard.

667
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,880
I cause a bit of havoc, really, throughout...

668
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,240
She falls for me!

669
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,520
LAUGHTER

670
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,200
I can see that. I can see that.

671
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,080
There is a big love affair that goes on.

672
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,840
But exactly the same as Toby said,

673
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,160
when I saw the plethora of fantastic actors, this one being right there,

674
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,960
I wanted to be a part of it.

675
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,240
Actually, what's nice about it is you don't...

676
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,520
I mean, it is a stand-alone.

677
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,720
It's not full of in-jokes.

678
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,600
Well, obviously a TV comedy is 25 minutes long -

679
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,320
in a movie, what is great about the script is they had to find a way

680
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,360
of extending it. They could do a scale,

681
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,680
a story of scale, in a way that you can't do

682
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,680
in a half-hour studio sitcom.

683
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,160
So, there's...

684
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,800
It's based on a true story, what happens in the movie.

685
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,200
It was Operation Bodyguard, where the Allies used... Can I say this?

686
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
- ..inflatable tanks.
- Yeah.

687
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
Ugh! You blew everything!

688
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,320
Spoiler alert!

689
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,320
The inflatable tanks won't ruin your enjoyment.

690
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,760
Let's see a bit of Catherine, Toby and the boys in Dad's Army.

691
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,240
This is a taste of the trailer.

692
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
Bravo, Mainwaring.

693
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
Eyes front, soldiers back.

694
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,320
You're a sergeant in the Home Guard, not a sack of potatoes.

695
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,280
It's all hands on deck.

696
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,640
'An enemy spy is operating somewhere near here.'

697
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
I'll catch him, sir.

698
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
What does he look like?

699
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,560
We don't know, Frank, that's rather the point with spies.

700
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,960
Stupid boy.

701
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
HORN BLARES

702
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,680
Associated Press. I'm doing an article on the Home Guard.

703
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,080
You come highly recommended.

704
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,680
You remind me of someone...

705
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
Winston Churchill.

706
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,360
I like to think that if we met,

707
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,120
we'd both be the richer for it.

708
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,320
Oh, yes.

709
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,640
I took my mum, she loved it. Laughed like a drain.

710
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,840
- She like it, your mum? 
- She did, laughed like a drain.

711
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,640
I was telling her to shut up.

712
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Actually, Dad's Army, did they ever show it in America? No?

713
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,160
It replaced religion in Canada!

714
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,400
No, we don't know. Here it is, like, they're reverent of it.

715
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,520
They just love it. They were talking about it all day today on my junket.

716
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,960
When did they stop making it?

717
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,760
They stopped making it in '70-something?

718
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,560
It's still on every week on BBC Two.

719
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,680
It reruns and everyone watches it, though.

720
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah. The figures are great still.

721
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,120
- CATHERINE:
- Just when you think you've seen every episode,

722
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,840
you turn it on, another one pops up.

723
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,080
You might need some more promotion in the African-American community.

Right, it's music time.

I don't know if you are familiar with this lady, but she is stunning.

728
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,720
We have been waiting over three years for this moment.

729
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,520
But she is back now with her second album.

730
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,920
Here performing her current single, Overcome,

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,320
it is a warm welcome back to the lovely Laura Mvula!

Simply stunning. Come and join us, do.

785
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,400
Thank you to the dancers and the singers. Thanks to all of them.

786
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,920
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you very much.

787
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,960
Come and sit down.

788
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,760

Now, I'm hoping Toby doesn't suffer from allergies!

795
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
Sorry!

796
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
Sorry.

797
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,080
That is gorgeous, thank you so much for that.

798
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,640
Really, really lovely.

799
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,560
- It's the new single, Overcome. It is out now.
- It is out now.

800
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,840
- It is!
- Oh, my goodness.

801
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,520
I've heard it on the radio and everything, Laura Mvula.

802
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,720
It must be so nice for you to have a new song out.

803
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,560
This is special, because remember, my first ever TV moment

804
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,280
- was with you.
- Yes, it was. 
- You remember that?
- I do!

805
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,480
- Three years ago. 
- And look at you now!

806
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,560
- Thank you. And I have feathers! 
- You've killed a flock of something!

"And now I'm back!"

810
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,960
Well done, you. And there's a whole album. Finally.

811
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,320
The fans, I'm one of them, we have been waiting.

812
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,160
It is called The Dreaming Room, which is a lovely name.

813
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,960
That is out on the 6th of May.

814
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,120
- Yes, it is.
- Gorgeous.

815
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,920
Yeah, it took me three years to come up with some new songs.

816
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,680
I'm not ashamed of that.

817
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,240
It was a lovely song. I'd wait for it.

818
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,360
It's taken me, like, 14 years, so...

819
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,920
It would take me 100,000!

820
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,000
- Thank you! 
- You'd have to die and be born again.

821
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,440
It is so lovely to have you back.

822
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,960
Congratulations on the single. I hope it does really well.

823
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,160
I can't wait for the album. Laura Mvula, everybody.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

825
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,360
All right, before we head away,

826
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,760
there is just time for a visit to the big red chair.

827
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,200
Who is there? Hello, sir.

828
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,560
- Hey, Graham. 
- Hi, what's your name?
- I'm David.

829
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,560
- David, lovely. Where are you from, David?
- Hungary.

830
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,040
Oh, Hungary. OK. What do you do here?

831
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,520
I have two jobs. My main one is a hospital job,

832
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,920
the other is a weekend job working as a receptionist at a gym.

833
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,360
He's got it covered, ladies and gentlemen.

834
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,200
Hospitals, gyms.

835
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,600
He has made Britain healthier while he's been here.

836
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,760
Thank you. We all thank you.

837
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,400
Off you go with the story.

838
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,160
I'm originally from Hungary, but my first visit to New York,

839
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
I was at a Christmas party

840
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,160
with a bunch of people I didn't know very long.

841
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,680
It was before cellphones.

842
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,720
There was a phone in the living room.

843
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
I made a phone call to my cousin,

844
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,400
had a brief conversation in Hungarian.

845
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,720
At the end of the conversation I was like,

846
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,240
"Pussy, pussy, mwah, mwah, mwah."

847
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,800
Oh.

848
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,440
Everybody in the room froze, looked at me.

849
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,640
I was like, telling my cousin, "Why is everyone looking at me?"

850
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,920
My cousin said, "Do you know what you said in English?"

851
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,760
Because in Hungarian, "puszi" means a kiss on the cheek.

852
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,200
It doesn't mean that here.

853
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,960
Exactly, but I didn't realise...

854
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,840
I doubt it means that in Hungary.

855
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,360
I didn't realise it either until everybody looked.

856
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,600
And there was children.

857
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,760
It was a Christmas party with kids in there...

858
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,960
Oh, that's wrong.

859
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
Dispose of him!

860
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,360
- WILL:
- Hold on. One second.

861
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,160
On the cheek, here we go.

862
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,360
Now you know what I can say!

863
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,280
- "Dear Diary..."
- I was just a speed bump on his way to "puszi" there.

864
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,880
You slowed him, but you didn't stop him.

865
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,600
OK, who is up next? Hello, sir.

866
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,400
- Hello.
- Who are you?
- I'm Paul.

867
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,760
Paul, lovely. What do you do, Paul?

868
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
- I'm a tour guide.
- A tour guide?
- Yes.

869
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,640
Oh, around what or where?

870
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,280
The BBC.

871
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,960
LAUGHTER

872
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,840
You want me to just flip him?

873
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,800
(If the walls could talk!)

874
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,880
"And in this room... No, never mind."

875
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,600
OK.

876
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,480
- Is your story about that, Paul? 
- No, it's not.
- OK.

877
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Off you go with your story.

878
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,120
My son Jay is about 18 now, so he will kill me for telling this story,

879
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,480
but when he was very little, I took him swimming.

880
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,080
It was his first time there out of nappies.

881
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,720
Before we headed to the pool, I said, "Do you need the toilet?"

882
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,400
- CATHERINE:
- I don't like toilet stories, can I flip him?

883
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,600
He said no. We got in the pool eventually

884
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,200
and as soon as we got in the pool, he needed the toilet.

885
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,720
We went to the toilet and came back.

886
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
I was a very bad father then. I whispered in his ear,

887
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,160
"If you need to wee again, just do it in the pool.

888
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,040
"No-one will know, everybody does it, it's OK."

889
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,840
Of course I regretted this five minutes later

890
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,680
when he stood very proudly on the side of the pool...

891
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,080
LAUGHTER

892
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,120
..peeing into the water very majestically,

893
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,080
like an ornamental fountain,

894
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,320
whilst all the swimmers dived for cover

895
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,600
and all the lifeguards blew their whistles.

896
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,440
Oh, you can walk. Well done, Paul! Very good.

897
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,720
Good story. Good story.

898
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,240
Well done, everyone.

899
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,440

909

914
