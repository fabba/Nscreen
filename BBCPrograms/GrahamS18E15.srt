6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,120
This programme contains strong language.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,040
Hello! Hello!

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,560
Too kind, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you!

LAUGHTER Erm, everyone...

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,160
What's happened to those animals? It's so...

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Everyone loved the series Life On Earth,

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,000
where David met gorillas in their natural habitat.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Now, gorillas are expert communicators.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
And apparently, they had a subtle way of letting David know

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,040
when they'd had enough of being filmed...

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
We hear ya. Let's get some guests on!

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
Right, he's the most successful stand-up comedian in America

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,360

Straight out of Compton, it's Ice Cube!

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,240
- It is Ice Cube!
- Hey! What's up? 
- Really nice to see you.

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,720
CHEERING DROWNS OUT SPEECH

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,600
- Ah, everyone good? 
- Yes, thank you!
- Whoo!

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,440
Now, the weird thing is, Ice Cube, we could be related.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,200
Because, erm... LAUGHTER

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
Apparently, apparently there is some Irish stock in your past.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,880
- No. 
- LAUGHTER

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,040
I mean, there could be. You never know. Erm...

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,080
- But you have an Irish name.
- Do I? O'Shea.
- O'Shea is a Irish name!

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,360
It couldn't be more Irish. Has no-one told you that until now?

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,400
No, I've been told. But, you know, I think my mother just liked the name.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,880
- OK, so, it's your Christian name? 
- Yes, my...I think?
- Listen.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Let me educate you on something.

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Black people, black people are notorious for picking things

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,640
that they saw one day and saying, "That's my baby's name."

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,480
LAUGHTER

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,200
That's all it was. That's all that was, Graham.

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,600
There was no amazing story behind it.

67
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,800
I would love to tell you, "Yes, it came from the Irish forefather that did this..."

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,120
That's not the case. His mother was reading the paper,

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,440
and she was eating some cereal, and somebody in the back said, "O'Shea!"

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,520
She said, "That'd be a good name for this baby." And that's it.

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,280
- That's how it happened! That's it. 
- LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Here's a thing. You are here promoting your movie, but, Kevin, you're working at the same time.

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,520
- You're doing stand-up gigs. 
- Yeah, double dipping.
- Yes!

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,320
- LAUGHTER 
- Uh, doing a ton of stand-up shows.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,400
My What Now? Tour is here as well.

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,760
Uh, major thank-you to the UK fans. The tour sold out in, like,

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,480
- literally, two days. So, you guys are amazing. Way back when.
- Wow!

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
So, we did that and then after that we came over here for promo.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
What Cube and myself love doing

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,480
is really getting involved with the fans.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,680
You know, we love putting our feet on the street and really being active

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,400
- and interacting. So, we've been doing a ton of pop-ups.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
Just delivering the movie, the best of our ability, which is live and in person.

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
- And we're splitting all the tour money.
- That is not true.

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
- LAUGHTER You got him here. 
- And I'm here.
- That's not true.

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,120
- You know he bum-rushed my stage the other day?
- Oh, did he? 
- Without telling me.

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
He tackled me from the back. Scared the living mess out of me.

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,840
- LAUGHTER 
- It was one of the most frightening moments of my life, to be honest.

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
I think we may have another frightening moment for you. This is you in Manchester.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Now, do you even know the name of that show?

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,120
- LAUGHTER 
- I was the only black guy there that day!

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
- I remember that.
- Or ever.

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
- Uh, that's Coronation Street, right? 
- Well done!

95
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
That's you and Beverley Callard.

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,200
But THIS picture, this looks like you have been Photoshopped in.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,680
- Yeah! 
- LAUGHTER

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,520
Are you really there? Roy's Rolls can't be that big.

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,560
First of all, it looks like I grew up there.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,360
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

102
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
And Olivia, with Broadchurch,

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,680
presumably your kind of level of recognition has gone up.

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,960
- You must get recognised all the time now.
- Yes.
- Yes, I do.

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh, I know where you're going with this.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,720
- Yes. Yes, well, do tell them. 
- Erm, I hope my mum's not watching.

107
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,040
- LAUGHTER 
- There was a slight road-rage incident.

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,120
And you know those crossings where they're absolutely,

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't know if it's the same rules apply, but they're not staggered,

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,960
they're straight crossroad thing... Do you know what I mean?

111
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,320
I have no idea what you're talking about,

112
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,440
- but keep going.
- So, to turn right, you have to turn in front of each other,

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,880
not behind each other on a staggered crossing.

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,320
- Do you know what I mean?
- No!

115
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,560
- Does anyone know what I mean? 
- PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE:
- Yes!

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,680
- So, so...
- No, don't!

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
OK, and you've got to go behind each other.

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,600
No, you have to go in front because it was an equal thingy.

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
- You had to go in front of each other?
- Yes.
- OK.

120
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
So, this woman was coming towards me and wanting to go right, her right.

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,240
And I was going right. So, I turned to go in front of her.

122
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,400
And she went... And, as if I had tried to drive into her.

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,840
And I thought, "OK, well, there's no-one else coming.

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,440
"So, I'll just, to keep her happy, I'll do what's wrong

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,600
"but I'll go behind her." And she was, like, doing that...in the car.

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,840
And it was starting to really piss me off

127
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,760
because I was right and I was helping her out.

128
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
And then I suddenly got this red mist.

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,760
Just as our cars were coming next to each other, I suddenly went,

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,560
"Fuck you!"

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,320
- LAUGHTER 
- And just as she was doing that, she went, "Ah!"

132
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,200
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,320
And now, Hugh Laurie, straight out of Oxford...

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,960
LAUGHTER You have had some rap experience.

135
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
LAUGHTER

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,360
- I think you, you may have been misinformed there. 
- We've got evidence.

137
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,560
Well, well now, well now...

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,560
- Have you started? 
- Yeah, that's the opening line.

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,040
Where can I take it from there? Well, now. It's called Well Now.

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,280
I... I dabbled.

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,200
- It was you and Stephen Fry.
- Yeah. 
- And what was it actually called?

142
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,240
It was called... It was called I'm A Good-Ass Motherliker.

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,680
That's what I like to hear.

144
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,400
- Yes, it was nice, polite rap. It was polite, English rap.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,760
- We've got a little clip, just so you can enjoy it.
- Oh, no, you haven't!

146
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,280
Yes, here's Hugh Laurie doing his polite rap.

147
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,000
# Get home to my bitch She be waitin' all alone

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
# I put water in her bowl And I give her a bone

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
# Neighbours come callin' Holdin' out a cup

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
# So I get out the sugar And I fill it right up

151
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
# Be nice

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,200
# Be nice Cos I'm a good-ass motherliker. #

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,680
HE MOUTHS

154
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,520
That thing was hot! Everything was hot except the pants.

156
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,880
- Yeah, the pants was off. 
- Everything else was great.

157
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,360
First of all, it was 1995, for God's sake.

158
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,640
I mean, your swag is on 1,000 right now!

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,480
Now, the guys are here because they've got the sequel to Ride Along,

- Yes. 
- LAUGHTER

162
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,440
- Watch out, Graham. You nailed it. You nailed that.
- Sweet.

163
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,560
I've got the facts, ladies and gentlemen.

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, it opens here tonight.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,480
But, of course, it's already opened in America. Huge hit.

166
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,400
Knocked Star Wars off the top of the tree. All that.

167
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,360
So, what is the premise of the movie?

168
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,880
The premise of the movie, I play a crack detective out of Atlanta.

169
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,760
And I have this bug, mosquito, by the name of Kevin Hart.

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,240
- That's not it. 
- He wants to marry my sister.

171
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,040
So, you know, it's the whole thing of, you always hate the guy

172
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,600
that wants to marry your sister, so, you know, I hate him over here.

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
That's a strong word. You dislike me.

174
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
- LAUGHTER 
- And I'm trying to scare him from not being a cop by taking him

175
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,280
on a ride along and it doesn't work cos he ends up helping me

176
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,320
solve the case.

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
There's a lot of stuff that happens on that ride.

178
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,480
I mean, you're looking at a relationship with two guys that's a grounded, genuine relationship.

179
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,440
You know, my character, Ben Barber, aspires to be what James is.

180
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
What means the most to me is this man's approval.

181
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,280
But getting that approval is tough.

182
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,320
So, along this road, it's about me proving myself above and beyond

183
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,080
and eventually getting the attention of the guy that I look up to.

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,960
And reading interviews between you, it's unclear, like, do you get on, on set?

185
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,920
- Or do you genuinely annoy each other? 
- That's my best friend.
- OK.

186
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
- Say it! 
- LAUGHTER

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,040
Say it! Come on, man. Say it! We're in the UK.

188
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,080
Say it, let 'em know how you feel. Best friend touch, come on, man.

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Come on, man. There it is.

190
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

191
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,520
- But didn't he steal your catchphrase? 
- He always steals everything.

192
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,400
- When people see me, they'd be like, "Yo, Cube! Yay-yay!"
- Hey-hey!

193
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,680
- LAUGHTER 
- Good, good. I'm not going to say that.

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,880
- So, I say, "Hey, Cube! Yay-yay!" 
- Hey-hey!
- That's so weak.

195
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,080
- It has no flavour to it. 
- We're best friends.

196
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,120
We've got a clip from the movie, erm, Ride Along 2.

197
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,400
- This is, erm, you guys trying to get into a party under cover.
- Ah.

198
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,240
And your antagonism is barely concealed.

199
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,400
- Prince Admiral Steven Matumbe. And you're in consul.
- Plus 2.

200
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,000
- My two servants.
- I don't have you on the list.
- Well, could you...

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Then check the VIP list. And do not look me in my eye.

202
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
Don't look at me. You look at the pad.

203
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,720
You read the names and you look at me and you close your eyes.

204
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
Look at me. Don't look at me. Look at me. That was a test. You failed.

205
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,640
- You...aren't on it. 
- Stall him, guys. AJ is on it.

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,440
- Step aside, por favor.
- Wait!

207
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
This is all your fault.

208
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm your bodyguard, not your servant.

209
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
You are what I SAY you are!

210
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,600
- A traditional sign of respect. 
- 'OK, try it now.'

211
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
Check the list one more time.

212
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,640
There it is. Sorry about that.

213
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,120
- You can head right in. 
- I cannot feel my face!

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,440
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

215
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,120
And Ice Cube, we've got to mention Straight Outta Compton.

216
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,760
Congratulations. Oscar-nominated.

217
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

218
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,160
- Oscar winner for best original screenplay.
- Yes.

219
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,880
And obviously, cos the Oscars have now got mired in this controversy this year...

220
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,960
So, where do you stand on all of that? Like, will you go? Are you going?

221
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,840
- I never used to go anyway. So... 
- You're not boycotting?

222
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,480
You can't boycott something you never went to anyway.

223
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
- LAUGHTER 
- That's kind of weird.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,160
No, it's, you know, I look at it like a horse race, you know

225
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,360
what I'm saying? Once your horse loses a race,

226
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
you tear up your ticket and go on and just back on out.

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,400
Because it's nothing really to put that much energy into like that.

228
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,480
It's... We don't do movies for the industry.

229
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,360
We do movies for the fans, for the people, and, you know,

230
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,640
the industry, you know, if they give you a trophy or not, or pat you on the back or not,

231
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,360
it's nice but it's not something that you should dwell on.

232
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,000
You know, we got accolades from all levels, you know, from our core fans,

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,560
from our curious fans, from our fans or people who, you know,

234
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,400
didn't even think they wanted to see that movie.

235
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,960
You know, I think the older generation got a understanding on why we did

236
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,760
that kind of music and the younger generation got a history lesson.

237
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,000
And we got so much praise for the movie, and it's like, how could you

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,960
be mad cos ONE other Academy or guild or anybody didn't say it's the number one,

239
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,360
you know, it's like crying about not having enough icing on your cake.

240
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,560
- LAUGHTER 
- I mean, it's just ridiculous.

241
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,360
- Because you guys have both seen the movie, haven't you?
- Yes.

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
Yeah, have to say I loved it. Absolutely loved it.

243
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,040
And I think, by the way, that that's about the sanest description of this whole process

244
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,640
of awards that I've ever heard. I mean, as a way of treating it, as a way of thinking about it.

245
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

246
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,520
And was the process of the making of the film,

247
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,240
did it kind of rebuild bridges with the existing members of NWA?

248
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,520
- Are you all kind of good and...? 
- Yeah, we were already cool, you know?

249
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,400
It was water under the bridge by the time we started doing the movie.

250
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,280
It was great to get with everybody and hash up all those stories.

251
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,880
And, "No, that's not how that happened," "Yeah, yeah..."

252
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
And then going back and forth and creating a whole,

253
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,760
uh, you know, script. It was a load of work. It was a major process.

254
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,160
A lot of cooks in the kitchen. Erm, but we got nice meal out of that.

255
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
You're getting back together, is that right?

256
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,520
Are you going to play Coachella?

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Well, we're going to definitely play The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame cos NWA was inducted.

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,200
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 
- And now... Thank you.

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,320
So, that's great. And then, you know, I got Coachella.

260
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm a try and get all the guys together and do an amazing show.

261
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,560
- I'll do it. 
- LAUGHTER

262
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,640
I'll do it. You don't even have to ask. I'll do it.

263
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,720
And he's not joking, is he?

264
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I'm here for my friend.

265
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,080
And great, sort of extraordinary that your son did such an amazing...

266
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,000
- Oh, yeah!
- ..job playing you.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,480
I mean, that's what I'm most proud of, you know,

268
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,400
more than having this movie, having Straight Outta Compton,

269
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,880
this, that and the other, is the fact that my son was able to take a opportunity, you know,

270
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,760
and run with it and hopefully set himself up and in, you know,

271
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,080
one of the greatest industries in the world.

272
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,640
Uh, and, you know, I'm so proud, just as a father, and,

273
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,200
oh, yeah, you know, it was a movie about NWA too. You know that?

274
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,760
But how much did he know, like, when he was doing scenes,

275
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,160
- was he going, like, "You did THIS, Dad?"
- Yeah, yeah.

276
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,720
In the hotel rooms, you know, some of them scenes, it was like...

277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,280
- LAUGHTER 
- Oh, man! Y'all took guns? Man! Y'all was doin' the most!

278
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,680
- Those were your favourite scenes too!
- But he did know.

279
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
How old was he when he knew the lyrics to Straight Outta Compton?

280
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Oh, they was young, man, you know, my kids... Two? Three years old?

281
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,160
I mean, it was playing all the time.

282
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,200
And, you know, they were rapping and would censor themselves.

283
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
They would like rap the lyrics, like,

284
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,080
# Straight Outta Compton, Crazy mo...named Ice Cube

285
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,880
# From the...called...With Attitudes #.

286
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,160
Profanity, you know what I mean? It's just funny.

287
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,800
And, Hugh Laurie, you've got kids

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
but none of them have followed in your footsteps, have they?

289
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,520
- STERNLY:
- No.

290
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,240
LAUGHTER

291
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
- No, they haven't. I mean... 
- Do they have proper jobs?

292
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,360
They all do different... proper jobs, yeah.

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,960
They all did a bit. They all tried it. And were good at it, actually, I thought.

294
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,000
But didn't want to, erm,

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,120
I just think it's an amazing thing to think of your son doing this.

296
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,480
Because I, you know, most men are in some version,

297
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,640
- trying to play their father anyway. 
- Mm-hm.

298
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
You know, either imaginary or real,

299
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
they're trying to sort of play the role of their father,

300
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,320
until they find out, you know, if they ever DO, some don't,

301
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,920
if they ever find out who they are.

302
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,040
I think that's just an incredible thing.

303
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,600
I mean, I had a very, very sort of mild version of it.

304
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Because I was playing,

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,080
I spent almost ten years playing a doctor and my father WAS a doctor.

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,360
And I felt like I was a fake version of what he really was

307
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,200
and I felt all this, sort of, constantly guilty about that.

308
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Erm, because I think a lot of men do actually grow up feeling like that.

309
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,800
Feeling like fake versions of their own, until you hopefully get

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,160
to a point where you think that, "Well, I am the real thing, in some form."

311
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
- Yeah, yeah.
- It is, whatever it is, it's real.

312
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,800
- Because, Olivia, how many kids have you got now?
- Three!
- Three?

313
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,920
So, if one of them, or indeed all of them came to you and said, "Yay!

314
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,440
"We're going to be an actor or actress," would you be thrilled? Horrified?

315
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,800
I don't know, it's quite a hard thing to answer.

316
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,680
Because I love it. I love my job. But I know I've been lucky.

317
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,080
So, it would be quite hard for my kids to go into it and be less lucky or...

318
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,200
Yes, you wouldn't say, I'd like you to be a SUCCESSFUL actor.

319
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,120
- Teach them to be lucky. 
- They're also very clever.

320
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,880
They're much cleverer than me, so, erm, well, it's hard to know with the baby but, erm...

321
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,480
It doesn't walk into walls or anything. That's good.

322
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,920
Yeah, I'd like to think that maybe they'll do something,

323
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,160
you know, save people or change the world.

324
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,600
- Oh, wow.
- No pressure!

325
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,560
LAUGHTER

326
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,360
And Kevin, your kids, do they aspire to be a performer like you?

327
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,480
Oh, yeah, I'm in trouble. My kids are just like me. It's scary.

328
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,960
It's so scary. No, my son, my son is a little slower.

329
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,280
My daughter is just...

330
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,800
That's my son. I catch my son...

331
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,040
I catch my son doing some of the stupidest stuff.

332
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,240
Son, why you licking that wall? Don't lick the wall, boy.

333
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,640
"I'm just playing." No! You're not playing, licking the wall, son!

334
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,200
Go over there and just play with that stuff.

335
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,760
My daughter is just, she's in love with what I do. She fully gets it.

336
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,560
My daughter is ten years old.

337
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,840
And, you know, I'm big on letting my kids see me in my work environment,

338
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,040
whether it's on set, whether it's on stage, tour,

339
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,400
I let them be around their dad, so they can really understand what I do.

340
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,920
My daughter sits, like, when I'm on stage, I don't let them,

341
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,400
they're only allowed to watch the first 7 to 10 minutes of my show

342
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
because that part is clean.

343
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,840
- Then it gets filthy after that. 
- LAUGHTER

344
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,920
So, the first 10 minutes, she just sits and she watches

345
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,680
and she mimics me in the house. My daughter has got a tight 5 minutes.

346
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,920
She's like, "Dad, introduce me," like, she's got my mannerisms.

347
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,400
She comes on the stage and she's like, "What do you do?

348
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,840
"What's your job? What's your name?"

349
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,200
It's scary! It's really scary.

350
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

351
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
So, Ice Cube had his son in this movie.

352
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,640
Olivia Colman has gone one further, ladies and gentlemen,

353
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,040
because in her new show, she had her daughter IN her,

354
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,720
in the thing, it's like Russian dolls!

355
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,360
- Yeah! 
- LAUGHTER

356
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,640
- And your bump plays a role.
- Yes!

357
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,080
- This is The Night Manager, the new series that you're in. 
- Oh, IN her! Oh!

358
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,200
- In her! 
- LAUGHTER

359
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
- Where were you going? 
- I don't know...

360
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,200
You guys nodding, going, "OK..."

361
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,560
It's a UK thing. All right. I got it. I got it.

362
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,120
But they wrote the bump in.

363
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,440
Yeah, when I first went to meet the director

364
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
and I had just found out I was pregnant and I thought, "Oh, I can't lie."

365
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Because it's going to become obvious. And so I said I was pregnant.

366
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,080
And Susanne went, "Oh! Oh, OK..." She said, "I must talk to the producers."

367
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,000
This is my impression of Susanne.

368
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,360
- LAUGHTER 
- Lucky she's not here cos then I can tell you it's really good.

369
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,320
- OK.
- It is. It's absolutely spot on.

370
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,400
And I was going, "If you remember Fargo, Frances McDormand

371
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,440
"was pregnant and it really added to it. I think it would help," sort of, fingers crossed.

372
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240
And they came back and said, "Yeah, OK,

373
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,560
"we can do pregnant, yeah. Erm, yeah, we'll write it in." So...

374
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,040
And it's good because you didn't have to carry a bag in front of yourself or wear baggy coats or anything.

375
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,880
I got so big, there would have been no hiding it.

376
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,320
And also, I was waddling quite a lot.

377
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,280
And Susanne once said, "Could you walk less pregnant?"

378
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
LAUGHTER

379
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
My pelvis was like that!

380
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,240
- So, this is The Night Manager, coming up on BBC One next month.
- See that?

381
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,040
I looked like someone, like I've snuck into the back of shot.

382
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,040
- LAUGHTER 
- It's clearly, it's like a model shoot.

383
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,800
- And then this spherical being. 
- It's like when they left the paper cups on the mantelpiece in Downton.

384
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,520
- ICE CUBE:
- She looks like she's back there fixing his suit! A wardrobe person!

385
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
- OLIVIA:
- Exactly!

386
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,560
You shouldn't, if she didn't say it, but when she said that, I thought,

387
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,920
"It kind of does look a little bit like that!"

388
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,440
If anyone's watching in America, by the way, it's also on there.

389
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,480
It's on BBC America and it's on AMC.

390
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,200
And I guess because of all that involvement, it looks amazing.

391
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,280
- It's got a huge budget, it looks like, for it TV show.
- Yes.

392
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,920
Americans do know how to make things look very good! It's exciting!

393
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,480
Obviously, it's the famous John le Carre novel but,

394
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,120
if people don't know, what can you tell us about it?

395
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,320
Who do you play within the film?

396
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,400
- I play, I'm proud to say, the worst man in the world.
- Ooh!

397
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,600
- We actually play sworn enemies. 
- Yes.

398
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,920
This is sort of the angel of vengeance

399
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,120
and I am the worst man in the world.

400
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,280
- And we... Let's say that, because there are no other actors here, let's say it's all about us.
- OK!

401
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,360
We wind up in, right at the end of the thing,

402
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,880
in a sort of final confrontation between, really, good and evil.

403
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,520
Erm, it's about arms dealing.

404
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,560
It's about a conspiracy to pull off a very terrible arms deal

405
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
with very terrible people.

406
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,000
And Olivia's character sets about trying to undo

407
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
the villain of the piece, the worst man in the world, which is me.

408
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,040
And why, because it's been changed, it wasn't a woman originally?

409
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Yes, no, that's right. My character, Burr, was a man.

410
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,160
And they thought they'd like to...

411
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,840
Burr would be a good person to turn into a woman.

412
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,320
I think you probably were there more than me in that discussion.

413
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,680
I was a horse. And I thought, we could have a talking horse.

414
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,800
Or why don't we have a person?

415
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
ICE CUBE SNIGGERS

416
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,400
But Hugh Laurie, you love this book.

417
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,280
I love... Well, Le Carre is... This is holy text for me.

418
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,480
- Erm, and I loved... 
- You know him, right?

419
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,680
Well, yes, I would like to say now I do, a little bit.

420
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,720
I don't think he'd blank me in the street.

421
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,080
- Weren't you at his birthday party? 
- I did. I got taken.
- I didn't!

422
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,120
LAUGHTER

423
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,280
I got taken as Stephen Fry's date,

424
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,680
to his 70th birthday party, at a restaurant in Hampstead.

425
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,920
And at this party were... I don't quite know who these people were

426
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,040
because you're not supposed to know anyway.

427
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
But it was something like the head of the CIA

428
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,760
and the head of the KGB were at this dinner. Big, big cheeses anyway.

429
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
And the place was crawling with bodyguards.

430
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,280
There was a lot of earpieces and people were packing.

431
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,400
- LAUGHTER 
- Yeah.

432
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,960
Was this in Compton? Was this in Compton?

433
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
- I think I know that spot. 
- LAUGHTER

434
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,240
- I have the lingo! 
- LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

435
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
During the dinner, one of his sons went whispering round the table.

436
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,720
There was a piano in the room and he went whispering round the table,

437
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,240
he said, "Does anybody know how to play Happy Birthday?"

438
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,280
And I said, "Well, if no-one else does, yeah, I'll do it if you want."

439
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,560
So they said, "OK.

440
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,600
"You sneak over to the piano, no-one's looking, sneak over to

441
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,520
"the piano, sit down there, we'll signal the kitchen, they'll light

442
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,800
"the candles on the cake and then they'll bring it in,

443
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,320
"you start playing." I said, "OK," so I sort of snuck over,

444
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,120
I sat down and I lifted the lid like this and I was all poised

445
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,080
and I could see the kitchen where they were lighting the...

446
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
I could see them fussing over the cake.

447
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
And they lit the candles, 70 of them,

448
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,040
so I'll shorten that bit, obviously.

449
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,120
And then the last thing they did,

450
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,040
because obviously this was the restaurant's habit, the last thing

451
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,200
they did before they brought out the cake was switch off the lights.

452
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,360
So the place went dark and there was an eruption of guns

453
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,320
and walkie-talkies.

454
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,440
"Nobody move, everybody on the floor!"

455
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,240
And I had to sort of... "No, really!

456
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,920
"Honestly, I am literally just the piano player."

457
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,200
- But order was restored, nobody died. 
- Wow.

458
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,520
Pretty exciting moment.

459
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,800
But it also shows you the respect in which le Carre is

460
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,200
held in the world of spying and intelligence.

461
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,560
We've got a clip but it's more of a taster of the whole series,

462
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,840
so here it is.

463
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,880
War's a spectator sport.

464
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,560
What do you want, Miss Burr?

465
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,240
I want to make you an offer. Bring down Richard Roper.

466
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,280
I want to put you inside his operation.

467
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,080
You will be in so deep, you'll worry that you'll never get out.

468
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,200
My name's Pine, I'm the night manager.

469
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,480
I think he may be playing both sides.

470
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
We need Richard Roper.

471
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
- I'm going to get you out of here. 
- And you think you're safe?

472
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,560
We are pulling you out.

473
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,400
Without me, you don't have an operation.

474
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,600
If you step out of line, we'll make you howl for your mother.

475
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Ooh.

476
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,800
APPLAUSE

477
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,200
- I'm going to watch that. 
- Yeah, I'm going to watch that.

478
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
Watch it, wouldn't you? Yes.

479
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,360
- You're in that. 
- I know, I can't believe it.

480
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,480
The last time she was on, she was promoting a film,

481
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,240
she didn't know who she was playing in the film.

482
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
It was finished, it was in the cinema.

483
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,400
It was a long time after we'd filmed it.

484
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,440
You might have checked before you came on a chat show!

485
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,520
I love how honest she is about it. "I have no idea. I don't know."

486
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,480
I don't know why they...

487
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,920
Also, cos contractually, no offence, but we're sort of asked to come...

488
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,640
All right, fine. Thank you(!) LAUGHTER

489
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Wow.

490
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,440
- She doesn't mean that. 
- I don't mean that. Oh, God!

491
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,000
She doesn't want to be here, ladies and gentlemen.

492
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I do, that's not true. I love Graham.

493
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,280
But I do wonder why they ask me to do it.

494
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,720
I don't help, do I?

495
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,040
KEVIN CACKLES

496
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,800
Ice Cube's thinking, "She's never being in one of my films, ever."

497
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,200
She's good.

498
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,560
- I like her, I like her. 
- Thank you very much. I like you.

499
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,160
All right, onto my next guest. He's been on our screens for 65 years.

500
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,840
And now, on the eve of his 90th birthday,

501
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,000
he's back at the Beeb with a new natural history special.

502
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,400
Please welcome broadcasting legend Sir David Attenborough.

503
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,000
CHEERING

504
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,360
Hello, sir. How are you? So nice to see you. Come in, sit down.

505
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,080
This is Ice Cube...Kevin Hart, you know Olivia, I'm sure.

506
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,200
CHEERING

507
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,680
Sit, sit, sit, everybody. Oh.

508
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,400
- Very nice to have you, thank you very much for joining us.
- Thank you.

509
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,320
You've said hello, you've met everybody.

510
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,280
I've been listening to you all. Laughing like anything.

511
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,560
You've met before, haven't you, Olivia?

512
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
Twice.

513
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,440
Oh, I'm so embarrassed. I was so excited to meet you.

514
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,400
Well, I didn't really meet you, I just sort of stumbled into you

515
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,320
and went, "I think you are amazing!"

516
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,800
You were very polite and then I realised I should leave

517
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,760
and then I did it a second time...

518
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,160
at a different occasion.

519
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,920
So third time lucky, there you go.

520
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,560
Friends now, friends.

521
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,960
Now, this new special, Attenborough And The Giant Dinosaur,

522
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,400
it's on on Sunday, BBC One, 6.30

523
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,320
and it's extraordinary that these discoveries,

524
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,560
really amazing discoveries, are still being made.

525
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,800
Why had this not been discovered before?

526
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,400
I suppose, it's comparatively rare. They lived in a rather remote place.

527
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,120
They lived in Patagonia, right at the far end of South America.

528
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,760
And, yeah, dinosaur fossils aren't all that common.

529
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,720
And a local man who had a big sand...sheep farm

530
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,520
saw this enormous bone sticking out of the cliff.

531
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,400
And he told local people and eventually a palaeontologist,

532
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,600
a fossil expert, came along and said, "Yeah, that's a dinosaur.

533
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,280
"And not only is it a dinosaur, it's a very, very big dinosaur."

534
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,160
And that particular bone was the thigh bone, this one,

535
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,320
and it's nine feet tall, three metres tall.

536
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,120
So it's huge, this animal.

537
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,520
It's incredible. I'll tell you what, before we talk about it some more,

538
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,680
because talking about it doesn't really convey the size of it,

539
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,000
so we've got a clip from the show that conveys just how big

540
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
these things were.

541
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,880
The first sauropods to appear on Earth

542
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,160
were comparatively small creatures.

543
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,240
This is a cast of the thighbone of one of them.

544
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,720
It's not even as big as my thighbone.

545
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,480
But after about 20 million years, SOME had become pretty big.

546
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,560
This is a thighbone from one of those creatures.

547
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,160
But then, after that,

548
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,680
our giant appeared. This is its thighbone.

549
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
- Isn't that nuts?
- Yeah.

550
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,960
You know... You know the dinosaur

551
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,880
- that's in the Natural History Museum?
- Yeah.

552
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,160
Diplodocus. Fills the entrance hall, you know?

553
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,920
- This one is half as big again, the new one.
- Oh, my God.

554
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,960
- Wow.
- Wow.

555
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,440
And what's more, old diplodocus,

556
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
the one in the Natural History Museum

557
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,000
could walk underneath this one's belly.

558
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,280
- And how many...?
- Mm-hmm! 
- LAUGHTER

559
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,080
Because they didn't just find one of these. It wasn't like a freak.

560
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,680
It wasn't like, "Oh, he's very tall for his age."

561
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,640
- There were a lot of these guys. 
- Well, there must have been

562
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,280
because otherwise there wouldn't be any more.

563
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,520
There were at least two.

564
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
- I'm with you. 
- Actually, it so happened

565
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,000
this particular deposit where

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,840
they found those bones, there are the remains of

567
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,920
seven different individuals, all of the same kind.

568
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,880
So they were all whoppers.

569
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,640
And in your own house you have some...?

570
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
No, I don't have one in my own house.

571
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,520
No, you do have some dinosaur things.

572
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,280
- I've got the occasional thing. 
- What have you got, what have you got?

573
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,240
- What do you want? 
- Well, I don't know.

574
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,520
What will you give me?

575
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,240
You've got a dinosaur...footprint, is it a footprint you've got?

576
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,280
- I've got a dinosaur footprint.
- OK.

577
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,080
Footprints, dinosaur footprints are quite common in Texas.

578
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,920
You can buy 100 yards of dinosaur footprint.

579
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,440
Kevin Hart's shopping already.

580
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,600
I was about to ask the price for that thighbone.

581
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,400
I know what I want to do with my money.

582
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,320
Something good to show off to my friends.

583
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,960
There was a Texas millionaire...

584
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,560
It became the fashion to buy 50 yards of dinosaur footprint

585
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,400
and put them in your garden, you see.

586
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,240
So jealous now. Kevin Hart looks so jealous.

587
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Bought 20 yards and laid them out and very proud of it

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,200
and then invited the next-door neighbour,

589
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,560
who was also a millionaire,

590
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,760
to come over and look at his dinosaur footprint.

591
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,400
So the visitor came in,

592
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,200
saw these immense footprints around and said, "My God, what are those?"

593
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,760
And he said, "They're dinosaur footprints."

594
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,960
And the millionaire visitor said,

595
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,000
"I had no idea they'd come so close to the house."

596
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,040
LAUGHTER

597
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,080
Now, I don't want to embarrass you but we have to mention you do

598
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,360
- have quite a large birthday very, very soon.
- Yes.

599
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,600
It's, well, 90, we can say it, it's 90. It's a thing to be celebrating.

600
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
APPLAUSE

601
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,000
How is it going to be marked personally?

602
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,840
How is it going to be marked by the BBC? What's happening?

603
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,440
I would like to ignore the whole issue.

604
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,800
The BBC is talking now about doing some kind of programme.

605
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,120
I don't know what but they're going to do something.

606
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,560
- They'll have to do something. 
- Oh, something. A cake.

607
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,200
And Hugh Laurie can play Happy Birthday.

608
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,440
Well, I'm...I'm there, I'm there.

609
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,280
APPLAUSE

610
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,080
OK, it's time for music. Now this Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter

611
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,320
is destined for great things.

612
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Here, singing her hit single Ex's & Oh's,

613
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,080
please welcome Elle King.

614
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,440
APPLAUSE

615
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,240
# I had me a boy Turned him into a man

00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,400
# Exes and ohs

648
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,840
# One, two, three They're going to run back to me

649
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,120
# Climbing over mountains and sailing over seas

650
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,400
# One, two, three They're going to run back to me

651
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,960
# They always want to come but they never want to leave

652
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,480
# My exes and the oh-oh-ohs They haunt me

660
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,560
Elle King, everybody. Come and join us, come and join us.

661
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,240
Come and join us, Elle King.

662
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,880
That was so fun, I love that song.

663
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,160
There you go, there you go, my dear.

664
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,000
Come and join us. We've got you a stool.

665
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,040
Amazing, thank you.

666
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,720
That's Hugh Laurie...Olivia...

667
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,520
- Hi, so nice to meet you. 
- And you.

668
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,200
Hi, nice to meet you. Oh, so nice to meet you.

669
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
Oh, my goodness.

670
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,520
Everyone, sit down, sit down, sit down.

671
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,520
- Do you want to take your seat first? 
- OK.
- Sit.

672
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,280
I thought you might have wanted to be part of the... I don't know.

673
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh, see, I just automatically think,

674
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
"Oh, he's being mean, he wants my seat."

675
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
We're not in the back of a car!

676
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,600
"I'll sit in the middle, I don't mind."

677
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,400
- No. We must tell the people, that is from the album Love Stuff.
- Yeah.

678
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,640
Where did the name come from?

679
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,800
- Erm... 
- SHE GIGGLES

680
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,480
A sex shop in Florida.

681
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,960
Anyone familiar?

682
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Yup!

683
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,800
Yes, I am.

684
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,440
Can I just say that I'm a huge, huge, huge fan

685
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,760
and Express Yourself was the first rap song

686
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,400
- that I learned every word to. 
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, you're talking to Cube?

687
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,240
LAUGHTER

688
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,960
Sorry, it's a mix-up. Got it.

689
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,240
- I know, my eyes are so big. 
- Got it, go ahead. Sorry.
- Wide-eyed.

690
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,640
It was my first, like, favourite hip-hop song ever

691
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,040
and I've been a crazy hip-hop fan ever since,

692
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,120
so it's awesome to be really close to you.

693
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
And it's awesome. Your song was crazy.

694
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,520
We was over here just nodding our head.

695
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,720
- That bass line is sick.
- That's when we were talking about the bass line.

696
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,560
Thank you.

697
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,920
That's how you get to black people, with a strong bass line.

698
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,000
That's how you get us.

699
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,280
And you are a fan...

700
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
I know you are particularly a fan of Sir David Attenborough.

701
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,080
- I am, hi.
- Are you?!

702
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,200
- Yeah. 
- Because you are a big animal lover.

703
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,360
I know collecting animals is a weird phrase to use.

704
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,040
No, don't make me sound crazy. People think I'm crazy enough.

705
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,880
No, I've rescued a lot of animals, I've found a lot of animals homes.

706
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,160
Crazy!

707
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,320
I only have three dogs right now, it's fine.

708
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,120
But over the years, you've rescued things that didn't

709
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,560
sound like they needed rescuing.

710
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
They did! To me.

711
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,120
- A rat?
- That rat was amazing.

712
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,960
But did it need rescuing?

713
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,760
I know, I see your eyes, someone told me

714
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,120
that you have a terrifying rat story.

715
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,280
I don't care for them.

716
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,360
They're very... Unbelievably smart, though.

717
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,880
I... I...

718
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,840
I've been sitting on a loo in India

719
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
and a rat comes up...

720
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
- GASPS 
- Oh, my God!

721
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,840
It's not attractive.

722
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,000
Are you going to be over here for a while now, promoting and stuff?

723
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
What day is it? I don't know.

724
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,640
It's Friday now.

725
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Oh, it IS Friday? Well, every day's Friday, right?

726
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
Yeah, on this show it is.

727
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,360
No matter when we do it, it's Friday.

728
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,560
Listen, just before we go, we've got

729
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
time for a visit to the big red chair, so let's do it.

730
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,120
- Who's there? Hello. 
- Hello.
- Hi, what's your name?

731
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,360
- THICK COCKNEY ACCENT:
- Tony. 
- Tony. Lovely Tony.

732
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,640
Nice to speak to you, Graham.

733
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,600
It's good, Tony, what do you do?

734
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,360
- I work in a secondary school. Teacher, Graham.
- Oh, yes?

735
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,960
A specific subject?

736
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
No, I work with mainly, now, behaviour,

737
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,240
- with all the little rascals. 
- Oh, right.

738
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,200
LAUGHTER

739
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,880
Does anyone think Tony isn't a real person?

740
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
On you go with your story, Tony.

741
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Yeah, what happened was, it was about five years ago...

742
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,640
LAUGHTER

743
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,760
..and we'd just gone back to school in January. I got me new suit.

744
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,160
- I always like to get a new suit for the new year.
- Of course.

745
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,800
Yeah, naturally.

746
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,560
And what's happened is, I've gone into the canteen as normal,

747
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,160
cos I always like to eat with the pupils and then go out on duty.

748
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,920
So I've gone down, it's my favourite,

749
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,280
there's a little roast dinner.

750
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,560
So I've gone into the queue, nice little bit of lamb,

751
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,200
roast potatoes, greens, gravy.

752
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,040
And I thought to myself... Cos normally I don't get an after.

753
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,960
So I thought, "I'll have a little after,

754
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,240
"little bit of apple pie and custard. Lovely."

755
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,680
I've got that, got me little tray,

756
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,240
walk round where you go to get the forks and knives and, as I've gone

757
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,120
round, there must have been a bit of water, I didn't see the water.

758
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,520
Me own foot's gone. I thought, "Shit, I'm going over."

759
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,040
And it went in slow motion. I can still remember it.

760
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,120
It was slow motion and I've got the tray,

761
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,280
I'm thinking, "I've got to hold that tray."

762
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,600
I've gone over, me back's hit the floor. The tray's gone over.

763
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,400
I've got gravy, custard, apple pie and a little bit of lamb.

764
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,200
And as I've looked up through the gravy and the custard,

765
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I can see 100 teenagers going, "Sir's gone over, Sir's gone over!"

766
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,800
And that's me story, Graham.

767
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,680
Oh, he can walk. APPLAUSE

768
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,240
Give me a little flip, Graham, give me a flip.

769
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,120
I'll give you a flip. Here you go.

770
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,120
Very funny.

771
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,280
Do you think Tony was real?

772
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,400
I didn't understand one word he said.

773
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,520
- ATTEMPT AT TONY'S ACCENT:
- "I had me tuna, me gravy, me custard..."

774
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,000
LAUGHTER

775
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,040
There was no tuna.

776
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,880
There was no tuna!

777
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,640
