AIR-RAID SIRENS

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,800
From mid-September, 1940, London faced night after night of continuous bombing.

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,840
It became almost a matter of horrific routine,

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,080
with wardens helping people to the shelters as the sirens wailed over blacked-out streets.

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,120
But one night and one image encapsulate the London Blitz - the 29th of December,

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,120
the second Great Fire of London, when St Paul's rose in its glory amongst the smoke and flames.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,320
On that night, the cathedral was surrounded by a ring of fire

9
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,000
as centuries of history went up in smoke.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,040
The landscape of London was changed for ever and those who were there will never forget it.

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,280
There was just one big red glow.

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,960
- Everywhere was red.
- You couldn't make out Tower Bridge or St Paul's? 
- It was all afire.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,400
Everywhere you looked was alight.

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,320
The Blitz was a new kind of warfare -

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,400
total war. Its victims were civilians - men, women and children,

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,960
attacked in their own homes and on their own streets.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,000
Throughout the summer of 1940, the Germans had tried to destroy British air defences.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,120
But the British had a new secret weapon. Radar.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,000
It gave the RAF warning before the bombers appeared.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,040
The system was barely completed before the German attack began.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,880
For inexperienced young operators, many of them women,

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,240
sitting at screens like this was tense. It took only six minutes for German aircraft to cross the Channel.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,280
Getting RAF pilots airborne in time and at the right place depended greatly on these radar operators.

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,080
Within minutes of receiving notice of incoming bombers,

25
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,080
RAF fighter pilots were scrambling to their planes.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,280
By the end of August, the British seemed to be getting the upper hand.

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,000
Every German shot down was one fewer to bomb Britain.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,040
Then German strategy changed. As usual, it was cock-up, not conspiracy, that provoked the change.

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,360
Hitler had argued against bombing of civilians on the grounds that it wouldn't achieve anything useful.

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
But on the night of August 24th, two German aircraft, hopelessly lost,

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,440
dropped bombs on central London - strictly off-limits to bombers.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,480
The first fell here at St Giles' Church, in the City of London,

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,960
where Shakespeare worshipped, Cromwell was married, and Milton was buried.

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Nine were killed and 58 injured.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,000
It was no longer a combat between young men high in the air,

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,840
but a war against ordinary men and women going about their daily business.

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,880
In retaliation Churchill ordered the RAF to bomb Berlin the next night.

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Hitler decided that the Luftwaffe should attack British civilian targets as a reprisal.

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
The daylight Blitz had begun.

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,240
Saturday, September 7th, started the German bombing campaign proper.

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,280
On Black Saturday, the Germans dropped 300 tons of bombs on London,

42
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,320
not only devastating the docks, their real target, but demolishing great areas of the East End

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,640
and killing or wounding nearly 2,000 civilians.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:33,040
When the bombers came back at night, they found London easily. Its flames were visible from mid-Channel.

45
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,080
The Luftwaffe seemed to have the edge at last.

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,600
In the next week, the Luftwaffe mounted repeated daylight bombing raids on London,

47
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,240
but under constant attack from the RAF.

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,000
Among the German bomber pilots was Ernst Wedding.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,520
The greatest threat was fighters -

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,280
much faster than a bomber.

51
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,400
And when he lets fly with his eight guns...

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,600
He only needs to puncture a radiator or oil tank

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
and you'd be in trouble.

54
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,520
The war in the air was not personal. It was a target.

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,480
You saw an aircraft. The fighter - the boys - attacked it.

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,200
It was, "Can we avoid the fighter?

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,880
"Can we run away or hide in the clouds?" That was our method of survival.

58
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,280
On the morning of September 15th, the pilots who would bear the burden of the battle were up early.

59
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,760
At Tangmere and Kenley, at Croydon and Biggin Hill, at Hornchurch, North Weald and Duxford,

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,160
veterans aged 25 rose at dawn to meet the German attack.

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,200
This is the actual control room

62
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,720
of Fighter Command's 11 Group at Uxbridge,

63
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,760
responsible for the defence of southeast England, including London.

64
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,240
On September 15th, Winston Churchill sat here, watching 20-odd young men and women gathered round that map.

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,440
At about 10.30 that morning, warnings from radar stations

66
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,440
brought the first markers of attacking enemy aircraft on to the map.

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,760
In reply, the British sent up planes from a dozen airfields, beginning with two squadrons from Biggin Hill.

68
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,160
As the first attackers crossed the coast, the battle began.

69
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,080
There was fierce fighting over London that day - even Buckingham Palace was hit.

70
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,120
But by nightfall it was clear that the Luftwaffe was losing.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Two days later, Hitler abandoned invasion plans and turned to the bombing by night of civilian targets.

72
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,920
By bombing at night, German planes were less vulnerable to attack by the RAF.

73
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,960
They also hoped to destroy British civilian morale.

74
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,920
Coventry got it in one night in November.

75
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,760
Over 500 people were killed and a 14th-century cathedral was reduced to ruins.

76
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,080
Many other cities suffered appallingly. This is Plymouth.

77
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,040
But London was the worst hit.

78
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,040
From mid-September, it was bombed almost every night.

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,680
Christmas 1940 had been very quiet. There was an informal truce in bombing operations on both sides.

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,720
But at about 5.20pm on December 29th, enemy aircraft were detected on the radar.

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,600
The warning was passed on to Fighter Command headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory

82
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,200
and down to the sector control rooms.

83
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,400
Here, as ever, they plotted the incoming aircraft

84
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,160
tonight coming in from the south.

85
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,920
As the Germans approached, 29 fighters were sent up.

86
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,760
But night-interception was still very much in its infancy

87
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,280
and no raiders were shot down.

88
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,320
The Germans flew on. They were heading for Target Area Otto - the City of London.

89
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,360
And by ten past six, they were over St Paul's.

90
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,760
SIRENS

91
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,560
As the sirens wailed, the people of London went underground, many into street shelters like this -

92
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,920
basically, a hole in the ground lined with corrugated iron and covered with earth or sandbags.

93
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Night after night was spent down here,

94
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,920
neighbours trying to sleep on benches like this while sounds of war raged overhead.

95
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,960
One Londoner wrote: "It's not the bombs I'm scared of any more, it's the weariness.

96
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,040
"Trying to work and concentrate with your eyes sticking out like hatpins after being up all night.

97
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,200
"I'd die in my sleep happily if only I COULD sleep."

98
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,240
For children in London, the shelters became almost a home from home.

99
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,680
Peggy Chusonis was 12 when the war began.

100
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,560
- Here's where we went into the shelter.
- That was...?
- OUR entrance. 
- That's just here.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,680
We ran up here every night.

102
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,560
It had cubicles with special names - the Ritz, the R.O., Number 10 Downing Street...

103
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,400
- And we used to make the tea in the house where we lived. 
- You made the tea for everybody?

104
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,680
Everybody in the shelter got a cup of tea, made in a watering can.

105
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,400
Stirred it with a broom handle. You never had a spoon long enough.

106
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,240
We used to have a piano down there.

107
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Really...had a good laugh.

108
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,640
But many of the PUBLIC shelters were far from safe, offering little protection against a direct hit.

109
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,640
In one raid, 164 people were killed when a block of flats collapsed on the packed air-raid shelter beneath.

110
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,920
Among them were Wolf Kramer, his wife Mildred and their daughter Pearl.

111
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,000
Wolf's body was identified, so he could be given a proper burial.

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,680
What remained of Pearl and Mildred was buried here -

113
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,480
a jumble of ordinary people in a mass grave.

114
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,000
The safest place to be was several hundred feet below the surface.

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,640
This is Aldwich Underground Station, where hundreds of families took refuge every night,

116
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,720
coming down these stairs laden with torches, blankets and Thermoses -

117
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,320
mothers and babies, courting couples and old people alike.

118
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,320
Down below, whole communities were created in Tube stations across London.

119
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,080
# If today your heart is weary

120
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,800
# If every little thing looks grey

121
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,480
# Just forget your troubles

122
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,800
# And learn to say,

123
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,760
# "Tomorrow is a lovely day!" #

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,200
But it wasn't all the cosy community of mythology.

125
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,560
The Government censored information, and pictures of demoralised civilians simply weren't published.

126
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,600
Tales of cowardice and hysteria were untold, casualty figures left vague.

127
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,080
There was a black market in the best places to kip.

128
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,120
And in one station several people were killed in the rush to get down.

129
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
The lists of civilian war deaths

130
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,200
record many children killed in a tube shelter accident.

131
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,680
But on December 29th, it was far safer down here than up there.

132
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,640
Above ground, teams of soldiers, mostly Territorials,

133
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,520
manned giant searchlights whose beams lit up the sky

134
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,560
to pinpoint enemy bombers and help the anti-aircraft gunners take aim.

135
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,320
But at this stage in the war, searchlights only reached 12,000 feet.

136
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,360
Above that and the raiders were safe from the dazzle of the lights.

137
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,440
These anti-aircraft guns could punch ten rounds a minute into the sky, yet they offered little protection.

138
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,920
They were powerful enough,

139
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,960
but despite searchlights and predictors which estimated the flight path of incoming aircraft,

140
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,000
they were often literally shooting in the dark.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,480
On the night of December 29th, the guns defending London didn't shoot down a single German aircraft.

142
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,320
But they made a vital contribution to morale.

143
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,360
To tens of thousands of civilians in their shelters,

144
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,160
the constant roar of the guns above was living proof that we were "letting them have it".

145
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,200
By 6.17 that evening, the bombs were falling all over the city.

146
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,240
Many of them were high explosives containing between 200 and 1,000 kg of explosive.

147
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
But that night

148
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,080
the Germans were experimenting with incendiary bombs.

149
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,600
Their warheads, made of magnesium,

150
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,120
burned so hot they melted steel.

151
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,160
They could penetrate the roofs of buildings to burn undetected in their very hearts.

152
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,640
A bomber could carry 700 of them.

153
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,080
It was the Sunday after Christmas and there were few firewatchers. By 6.30 the city was in flames.

154
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,120
As one fireman put it, "The whole bloody city is lit up."

155
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
BELL RINGING

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,240
All over London, fire engines were racing to the City and East End. But it was a losing battle.

157
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,280
Then the message came through that St Paul's itself was under threat.

158
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,320
Churchill gave the order that the cathedral must be saved at all costs.

159
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,840
But the firemen needed ammunition - water -

160
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,040
and bombs were hitting and destroying the mains. London was running out of water fast.

161
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
There was only one place to get more water -

162
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 the Thames.

163
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,240
The Germans were lucky. The tide was at an exceptionally low ebb that night.

164
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,600
To make matters worse, there was an unexploded parachute mine lurking somewhere in the mud just downstream.

165
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,320
Fireboats could pump the water out, but the firemen had to struggle with the hoses across 50 yards of mud

166
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,120
to get the water to a vast reservoir tank to be pumped into the City.

167
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,640
The firemen desperately hauled the heavy hoses through the streets towards St Paul's,

168
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,000
at constant risk from bombs, debris, embers and falling masonry.

169
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,160
One fireman,

170
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Sam Chauveau, began the evening on a roof in the heart of the Square Mile.

171
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,240
By the time we'd tackled the incendiaries on the Exchange roof,

172
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,280
the sky, which was ebony black when we first got up there,

173
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,800
was changing to a yellowy orange colour.

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,840
And it looked as though there was an enormous circle of fire.

175
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,120
It involved St Paul's Churchyard, St Martin's-le-Grand,

176
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,480
Aldersgate Street, Chiswell Street, Wood Street, Gresham Street...

177
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,720
Fires were developing in these streets almost simultaneously.

178
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,360
I had this terrible feeling of helplessness.

179
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,880
It was excellent planning on the Germans' part -

180
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,840
first send in the pathfinders and the fire-raisers

181
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,640
followed by high explosives, more incendiaries, and lots and lots of parachute mines.

182
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,480
Tens of thousands of incendiaries descended on the city

183
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,520
released from aircraft so that they fell in a cluster.

184
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,240
On the Stock Exchange we had a cluster of these bombs on a flat roof.

185
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Six enormous conflagrations engulfed the Square Mile,

186
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,920
flames leaping from building to building,

187
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,960
consuming banks, offices and London's history as they went.

188
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,320
In the centre of it all was Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral.

189
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,840
Eight Wren churches had already gone.

190
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,040
The Guildhall was in flames and down the river the docks were lighting up the sky.

191
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,560
The area around St Paul's was ablaze and bomb after incendiary bomb was landing on the cathedral itself.

192
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Teams of volunteer firewatchers, armed only with sandbags and stirrup pumps,

193
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:11,400
constantly patrolled the passageways in this vast building, dousing the fires as they started.

194
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,600
The most dangerous patrol was up here - on the stone gallery that runs round the famous dome.

195
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,160
Volunteers for this were selected for their head for heights.

196
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,320
At about 9pm, an incendiary bomb became lodged up on the dome.

197
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,560
The roof lead began to melt and fire in the timbers was imminent.

198
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,520
American reporters cabled that St Paul's was lost.

199
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,280
But suddenly the crisis passed.

200
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,400
The bomb slipped down here on to the floor of the stone gallery and was put out with a sandbag.

201
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,520
Elsewhere in the City, firemen were having to give up.

202
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,680
In the Moorgate area, they ran out of water completely, like an army running out of ammunition.

203
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,280
They were surrounded by fire.

204
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,440
There was a grille leading to a tunnel down which the men could escape. But their equipment was gone.

205
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Down the river, in the docklands below Tower Bridge, a public shelter had caught fire.

206
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,320
Peggy Chusonis was among the women and children who fled on to the burning street.

207
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,880
You just ran and hoped you'd be all right.

208
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:36,040
I can't remember where my mother was, or what had happened. We ran but nobody knew where we were going.

209
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,080
We went into the Metropolitan Wharf, which was opposite, one floor up,

210
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,560
stayed there all night, talking and just sitting on the concrete - we had no bedding.

211
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:55,400
And the dock wall was all this gunge, all coming through - butter, sugar or whatever...

212
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,440
through these slits, down the wall, where it had all caught alight.

213
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,560
And the smell of everything... was terrible.

214
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,600
SIREN

215
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,800
Just after midnight came the welcome sound of the All Clear.

216
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,840
Fog in the Channel had stopped more planes from coming over.

217
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,720
But the battle to save London was far from over.

218
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,720
The firemen fought throughout the long December night,

219
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,640
still handicapped by the shortage of water.

220
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,000
The situation was that dozens of appliances were standing around doing nothing

221
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,600
because there just wasn't water.

222
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,640
It wasn't until about three or four in the morning,

223
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,440
when the tide turned,

224
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,080
that we were able to bring some water in

225
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,240
into the fire zone.

226
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,840
We had a complete relay going into this area,

227
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,880
by St Paul's, by about five in the morning.

228
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,880
By dawn, together with my crew - I had a crew of five and myself...

229
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,280
we all of us had to go along for treatment to the St Bartholomew's Hospital,

230
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,320
and had our eyes treated.

231
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,400
Due to the smoke, the heat and the cold air,

232
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,440
we were all suffering with, eh... burning eyeballs.

233
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,480
Morning revealed the extent of the damage.

234
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,920
Among the many volunteers who'd spent the night helping the Fire Brigade was Jim Smith.

235
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,440
That one was blown out, I'm sure.

236
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,960
He was only 16 at the time,

237
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,880
on his first night as a volunteer firewatcher.

238
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,880
There was nothing but rubble. There was no traffic running. No traffic running at all.

239
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:05,320
As it started getting daylight, towards the morning, you started seeing the shells of buildings -

240
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,840
buildings on both sides of the road.

241
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,680
Tram lines were up in the air...

242
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,840
Everywhere you looked, there was rubble. London had really copped it that night.

243
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,800
It was a bad night. That will never go out of my mind -

244
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,640
the most terrifying experience I'd ever been in.

245
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,360
A dozen firemen were killed that night,

246
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,080
and many others were badly burned.

247
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,880
Elsewhere in London, civilians had also suffered.

248
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,240
Here in Loncroft Road in Camberwell, this side of the street came through unscathed. The other wasn't so lucky.

249
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,760
At number 38, 13-year-old Edward Marriner died.

250
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,920
At number 32, William Regardsoe and his baby son John were both killed.

251
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:02,000
At 29, the three Probert brothers - Arthur, Frank and Edward - all got it.

252
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,520
At number 27, they seem to have been having a party.

253
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,040
Violet Jeffries, her son Samuel,

254
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,080
her 16-year-old daughter Julia, and eight other teenagers were all killed.

255
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,120
The street was decimated, and it was just one amongst many.

256
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,160
162 civilians died that night and many more were seriously injured.

257
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,520
The German bomber crews had done their job.

258
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,480
When you drop your bombs, that's it. Now home.

259
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
Self-preservation sets in.

260
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Because you want to get home alive as well.

261
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,400
What happens where you dropped the bombs - that was immaterial to you.

262
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,640
See, later on, when you saw the destruction that had been created,

263
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,480
then it drove home to you - "Oh, I could have killed children, women..."

264
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,880
But there it was. That was war.

265
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
The next morning, people across London woke up to devastation

266
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
and set off for work.

267
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,520
Commuters at London Bridge Station that morning saw a completely different city.

268
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,040
Few had offices to go to.

269
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:45,080
They picked their way along, in a desperate semblance of normality. A vast clearing-up job had to begin.

270
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,920
Amongst the hundreds of buildings destroyed that night was a pub, The Blue Last,

271
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,960
which had stood here, just down from St Paul's, for over a century.

272
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,480
On the morning of December 30th, it was a heap of ruins.

273
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,520
Rescue teams searched for bodies. Others demolished walls left close to collapse.

274
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,560
Elsewhere, bomb disposal squads dealt with unexploded bombs,

275
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:21,600
including one parachute bomb hanging from the steel rafters of Charing Cross Station.

276
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,160
The legacy of the Blitz remains.

277
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,400
It is estimated that over 100 unexploded bombs lie beneath the streets of London.

278
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,800
Miraculously, St Paul's was saved that night,

279
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,840
but the landscape of the City of London was transformed.

280
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,400
And it was just one night amongst many.

281
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,160
30,000 people died in the Blitz on London.

282
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,200
Another 11,000 were killed in raids on other cities across the country.

283
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,960
Thousands more were made homeless.

284
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,000
Families were destroyed and lives were wrecked.

285
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,440
Centuries of civilisation were reduced to rubble. No-one was safe.

286
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,640
The reality of modern warfare had come home to roost.

287
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,240
The Blitz on London strengthened the resolve of the British High Command.

288
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,280
In 1940, this was the roof of the Air Ministry.

289
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,720
On that terrible night, when the City of London blazed and St Paul's was wreathed in flames,

290
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,840
Air Chief Marshal Harris - "Bomber" Harris - was up here.

291
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,400
The story goes that as he watched the city burn, he said, "Well, they're sowing the wind."

292
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,440
In due course, the Germans would reap the whirlwind

293
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,360
when the RAF bombed the civilians of Hamburg and Dresden.

294
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,120
