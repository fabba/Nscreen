00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
*

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,360
1066 was the year that invasion changed the course of English history.

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,200
A duke became a conqueror.

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,240
He landed here, beat King Harold at the Battle of Hastings,

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,480
and brought about the end of Anglo-Saxon England.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,840
It's a story of great men and great events, of tragedy, heroism and sheer bad luck.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
We call him William the Conqueror,

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,240
but to contemporaries he was William the Bastard.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,280
His father was Duke Robert of Normandy, but his mother was a tanner's daughter.

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,680
When he was besieging a French town, the citizens threw hides out to remind William of his origins.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,160
He wasn't amused. When he took the place he had them skinned alive.

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,640
It was a measure of the man.

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,560
By contrast, Harold was described as affable to all good men and the enemy of evil-doers.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,680
Harold was a son of Earl Godwin, the most powerful man in England after the King,

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
at times more powerful than him.

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,520
The family lived here at Bosham in Sussex. Their hall has long gone,

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,760
but the Saxon church in which Harold worshipped still survives.

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,600
In 1064, King Edward the Confessor sent Harold to Normandy.

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,640
He was shipwrecked, fell into William's hands and swore an oath for him.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Harold promised that when Edward died he would support William's claim to the English throne.

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Whether he made his promise freely no-one knows, but the story of his oath is told in the Bayeux Tapestry.

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,200
This replica panel from the tapestry shows a long-haired, moustached Harold -

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,920
he was a fine figure of a man -

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,560
riding here "ad Bosham ecclesia", to Bosham church.

25
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,080
He's about to set out on the journey during which he'll swear that fatal oath.

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
The oath was broken two years later.

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,800
When Edward died in January 1066 Harold himself was crowned King of England.

28
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,840
When William heard the news he decided to invade, and spent months preparing a fleet.

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,880
On September the 27th, the invaders set sail in 300 ships.

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,640
On the 28th of September, the invaders landed here on the beach at Pevensey in Sussex.

31
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Their cavalry was a force to be reckoned with. My horse Thatch has got Norman blood in his veins.

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,520
It can't have been easy bringing 2,000 horses the 100 miles from Normandy in open-top wooden boats.

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Harder still, getting them ashore.

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,280
This was the biggest amphibious operation since Roman times.

35
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,720
As William scrambled up the shingle he slipped and fell,

36
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,560
throwing out both hands to protect himself.

37
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
He got up with blood on his face.

38
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,480
One of his followers said it was a good omen -

39
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,920
he'd taken hold of England with both hands, meaning to guarantee it to his descendants with his blood.

40
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,960
This mishap apart, it was a bloodless landing.

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,440
The Normans spent their first day in the Roman fort at Pevensey.

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,640
Then it jutted out into the sea. Now it lies a few miles inland.

43
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,680
This was an important gain, but one thing must have worried William.

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,520
His invasion had been expected, so where were the Saxons?

45
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,160
A week earlier, Harold had received disastrous news.

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,200
His country had been invaded - not in the south by the Normans, but in the north by the Vikings,

47
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,480
who'd landed near York and beaten the local forces.

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Harold's army marched out of London and on September the 25th advanced on the Vikings at Stamford Bridge.

49
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Harold pounded up this road at the head of 6,000 men.

50
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,280
He knew all too well who his opponents were -

51
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,320
Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, and his own brother, Earl Tostig.

52
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,960
Both had claims to the throne.

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,320
Harold planned to take the Vikings by surprise.

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Scouts said they were some distance from their ships, where they'd left their armour.

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,080
The Vikings saw the sun glinting off the armour of Harold's host. It looked like sunlight on broken ice.

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,920
In order to get at the invaders, Harold's army had to cross the River Derwent.

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,960
There was a wooden bridge across it

58
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,400
somewhere here.

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,920
One of the Vikings had worn his mail shirt that morning. He stood on the bridge armed with a mighty axe.

60
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,440
He cut down dozens of Saxons.

61
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,880
Eventually one of Harold's men got into a barrel, went underneath the bridge, taking a spear.

62
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,920
As the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says, "He brogged the giant from below."

63
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,560
The way was now clear for Harold's men

64
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,000
to pour across the river and take on their enemies on the ridge opposite.

65
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,800
The battle was ferocious.

66
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,960
At its end, both Tostig and Hardrada were dead.

67
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,000
The invaders had arrived in 300 ships. The survivors needed only 24 to carry them home.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,840
Harold had destroyed a mighty army.

69
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,480
'The written accounts of this battle are very sketchy.

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,680
'Archaeologists like Richard Kemp can give us a sense of what it was like.'

71
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,600
What happened to the warriors who were killed?

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,640
Well, we actually have done an excavation of a local churchyard

73
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,960
and found people buried there who undoubtedly fell in the battle.

74
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
I've brought along one of the skulls that was excavated from this.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,320
It shows the signs of the battle in the form of the injuries here.

76
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:51,560
This is undoubtedly a sword, whereas this very straight line may well have been caused by an axe.

77
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,200
If you'd like to handle it, wear gloves. This is mid-11th century,

78
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,640
and therefore rather precious.

79
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,640
The injuries are mostly to the skull.

80
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,280
So we've got straight down wounds.

81
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,400
Several have taken the top off the skull.

82
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,080
We've even got one that comes down against the jaw

83
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,680
and then hits the collar bone.

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,720
Mostly to the upper part of the body. Not people with helmets.

85
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,160
A helmet would protect you from this sort of wound.

86
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,120
Another major area of injury is the upper leg and pelvic region.

87
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,440
- So some of them were hit by spears going in under the shield wall.
- Yes.

88
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,480
- Bring him down, and once he's fallen, he's hit on the head.
- Yes.

89
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:51,800
Once there's a gap in the shield wall and you can get through, you finish the person off with a hack.

90
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,320
These are evidence, perhaps, that there were two separate people.

91
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,720
- It brings the reality home.
- Yes.

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,240
That is a considerable injury and this was a field of major slaughter.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Just three days later, the Normans landed.

94
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:19,880
When Harold received the news, he ordered his exhausted army to begin the 230-mile march back to London.

95
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,520
With Harold away in the north, the Normans moved their base

96
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,560
along the coast to Hastings, and built a temporary fortification.

97
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
This castle was built later.

98
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,160
William's problem was simple. He had to beat Harold and take London.

99
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,680
But he couldn't move north.

100
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,720
His fleet would be vulnerable if he left it.

101
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,880
If he stayed put, he risked being bottled up in the Hastings peninsula

102
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,320
with the sea to his back.

103
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,600
William's only hope was to force Harold to come to him.

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,280
And the way to do that was to sting Harold into action using sword and fire.

105
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,520
William sent patrols out all over the area, and remorselessly burned and pillaged the nearby villages.

106
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,080
The inhabitants took refuge in churches.

107
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,920
This is Crowhurst, a few miles from Hastings.

108
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,400
In the weeks before the battle it was utterly destroyed.

109
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,760
The Domesday Book has one word for the villages William wiped out -

110
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,280
"vasta" - wasteland.

111
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,040
William's strategy worked.

112
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,800
Harold received news of the ravaging of the villages.

113
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,640
He was Earl of Wessex. These were his people under attack.

114
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,280
He summoned a council of war, probably to Westminster Hall.

115
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,800
His advisors urged caution,

116
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,480
and begged him to let his brother Gyrth lead the army while he stayed back to raise fresh troops.

117
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,000
This was not Harold's style.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,640
He said, "It was never my wont to lie in a lair while other men fight.

119
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,800
"William shall never hear that I dare not look him in the face."

120
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,240
On October the 12th, Harold marched out of London with his depleted army,

121
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
an army that Steve Pollington understands.

122
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,280
- How was it organised? 
- Beneath the King,

123
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,680
who was the supreme commander one might say, we had his personal followers.

124
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,360
These are the men known as housecarls.

125
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:02,200
Beneath them we have the thecnas - the theyns. These are men possibly a little like medieval knights,

126
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,640
bound by duty to follow their lord into battle, and not to leave the field if he didn't.

127
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,160
Beyond that we have the Anglo-Saxon fyrd -

128
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,520
the mobile army, the army in the field.

129
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,360
This business about not leaving the field after your lord had fallen - fine for poets.

130
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,880
But did it really happen?

131
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,440
There is evidence from a poem recording events at Malden in Essex in 991,

132
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,480
in which one of the old retainers of the ealdorman there - a chap called Burkneuth -

133
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,080
utters some memorable lines from Old English verse which go:

134
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,120
RECITES IN OLD ENGLISH

135
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,800
"Thought shall be the harder, hearts the keener, minds shall be the stronger

136
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,320
"as our strength diminishes."

137
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,160
Their leader was down, they had no hope of getting away alive, but they stayed behind,

138
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
they fought on until the last man was down.

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
Formidable men, aren't they? It's hard not to like them.

140
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,360
Harold ordered his army to rendezvous at a well-known landmark,

141
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,400
the hoar apple tree on Caldbec Hill.

142
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,800
As night fell on Friday, October the 13th, his men made camp.

143
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,240
A Norman chronicler tells us that the Saxons spent the night before the battle carousing up here.

144
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,520
He gives us an account of their toasts.

145
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,040
"Wassail" and "drinkheil".

146
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,080
He wasn't here. He may have been contrasting the wild English with the pious Normans,

147
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,680
who spent the night at prayer.

148
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,120
Many of the Saxons must have known this would be their last night on earth,

149
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,640
for tomorrow they would fight.

150
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,520
Early on the 14th, William heard Mass.

151
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,560
His men were fighting not merely for victory, but for survival.

152
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,880
He took the holy relics on which Harold had sworn his oath in 1064,

153
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,920
and at about six o'clock set off to fight a decisive battle.

154
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:47,720
As they reached the crest of Telham Hill, the Normans were confronted by an awesome sight.

155
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,320
Over there, on Senlac Ridge,

156
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,840
the Saxons were forming up -

157
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,480
7,000 men, the early sun glinting off swords and axes behind a wall of shields.

158
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,520
'To get an idea of how Harold's men fought, I'm talking to Alan Jeffery,

159
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,520
'expert on Saxon tactics, and known to his friends as Alan the Axe.'

160
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,560
I always think of the axe as being THE Saxon weapon. Was it important?

161
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,280
It was probably the most important weapon of the time.

162
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,320
Technique's the only way to survive in that kind of conflagration.

163
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,360
I have to have a style that will keep me moving and keep you away.

164
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,880
That was a figure eight.

165
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,920
In a wide form or a high form it basically takes this shape.

166
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,440
Now, that's on a wide arc.

167
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
On a higher arc, left hand or right,

168
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,400
it takes no effort at all for me to do that.

169
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,440
What is worth bearing in mind, when this hits you I get a rest.

170
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,720
But if I want to get closer to you,

171
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,040
it's easy to take your shield away.

172
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
Yeah, I think I get the point.

173
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,480
- Now, talk me through the axe itself. 
- OK.

174
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,760
It's largely iron - a precious commodity then - with a tempered steel edge

175
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,800
put along here, heat-welded on.

176
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,640
It has a diamond section there which gives it more steel.

177
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:27,680
In the hands of a skilled person this could fell a human or a horse with little effort at all.

178
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,240
This was the centre of Harold's line on Senlac Ridge.

179
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,480
He stood up here with his guard about him.

180
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,120
His men fought on foot, shoulder to shoulder, like their fathers before them.

181
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Theyns and housecarls, well armed, were probably in the front rank, the worse armed fyrdmen behind them.

182
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,080
7,000 men on a front a mile across.

183
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,520
The army's official war cries were "Holy Cross" and "God Almighty",

184
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,240
but when the Normans came in sight, these shaggy, bearded warriors beat their shields with their weapons

185
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,800
and barked out the older, pagan war cry, "Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!"

186
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,320
William had God on his side, and a banner to prove it.

187
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,160
He had secured the Pope's blessing,

188
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,200
arguing that Harold had broken an oath sworn on holy relics.

189
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,240
William's army formed up, with the papal banner, facing the shield wall.

190
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,480
The Normans were here in the centre, the Bretons were on the left, and the Flemings on the right.

191
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,320
William's plan was simple. His archers and crossbowmen would wear down the shield wall.

192
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,080
Then his infantry would tear gaps in it.

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,760
He'd send in the cavalry to break it.

194
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,040
To the accompaniment of trumpets from both sides, his archers let fly.

195
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,720
The arrows had little effect,

196
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,760
either sticking in the shields or passing over the line harmlessly.

197
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
The Saxons held firm under heavy fire.

198
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,120
William would have to mount a frontal assault against Harold's well-chosen defensive position.

199
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,760
Battle Abbey was built later. Its construction flattened the slope.

200
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,800
But it's still pretty steep and it must have been much worse then,

201
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,240
particularly with 7,000 Saxons up on top.

202
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,080
The infantry attack was a disaster, and the Saxons pushed the Normans back down the slope.

203
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
William now relied on his cavalry.

204
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,440
'Thatch and I are being given some hands-on training by Anne Hyland.

205
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,480
'She's an expert on the medieval warhorse.'

206
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,200
- Shield first, I think. 
- Heavier than you think, your Norman kite-shaped shield.

207
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,760
- What about the reins?
- Hold those a little bit above the horse's neck,

208
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,440
- so the shield actually covers your upper body.
- OK.

209
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,000
- How do I use the lance? 
- You can use it

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,040
overarm, as was the normal way, or else, as was becoming much more common, couched.

211
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,680
- That's tucked under my arm. 
- Yes, with a third of the length behind your body,

212
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:00,400
and the rest of it pointing at your enemy with all the force you've got. Your stirrup gives you a platform.

213
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,080
No, don't point it down. You want to level it at your opponent.

214
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:14,120
When you set your horse in motion, it's the weight and speed of the horse that delivers the shock.

215
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:21,640
Get your reins sorted. You're going in for the real thing now. Get your shield so that you are covered.

216
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,000
Keep your head pulled in so when you're charging you can eye along and aim.

217
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,040
Don't take your head off centre. You'll move your horse off centre.

218
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,240
Like many things in life, it's easy when you've done it once or twice.

219
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,680
Let's have a go.

220
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
Up with the lance!

221
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:11,600
On William's order, all three cavalry contingents - Flemish, Norman and Breton - charged,

222
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,840
1,000 horsemen thundering up the slope.

223
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,800
The Bretons hit the shields first.

224
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,480
They charged here on William's left where the slope is gentlest, making better progress than the others.

225
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:34,000
Their impact must been terrific but the Saxons fought back hard, bringing horses crashing down.

226
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,600
The Bretons could bear it no longer and folded back down the slope with Saxons roaring down after them.

227
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,640
This wasn't part of Harold's plan, but these men were fighting mad.

228
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,680
The panic spread.

229
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,720
Across the whole front, William's men recoiled down the slope.

230
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,760
A Norman chronicler admits, "Almost the whole of the army yielded."

231
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,800
A cry went up that William had been killed. Chaos followed.

232
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,360
It looked as if William's army would collapse,

233
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,920
giving victory to Harold.

234
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,400
As his fate hung in the balance, William rose to meet the crisis.

235
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,720
He galloped forward, pushing his helmet back so that he could be seen.

236
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
"Look at me!" he shouted.

237
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,760
"Look at me! I'm alive, and with God's help will be the victor!"

238
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,240
His will prevailed.

239
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
The retreating Normans turned,

240
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,800
and the Saxons who had pursued them suddenly found themselves outnumbered and vulnerable.

241
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,240
The Saxons were cut to pieces here, well in front of the shield wall.

242
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,680
The Bayeux Tapestry suggests that it was here that the King's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine were killed,

243
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,240
as horsemen swirled around them.

244
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,720
This was the decisive moment. William's personal leadership had rallied his army.

245
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,760
Harold had lost hundreds of his best men.

246
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,840
It was now about 11 o'clock and both sides paused to regroup.

247
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,240
Medieval battles rarely lasted more than an hour or so.

248
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
Hastings had already raged for two.

249
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,920
At about 12, battle recommenced.

250
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,760
William of Poitiers, a chronicler, called it an unknown sort of battle,

251
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,320
in which one side launched attacks, the other stood fixed to the ground.

252
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Poitiers says that William launched a number of feigned retreats,

253
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,080
drawing the Saxons down from the shield wall and killing them out in the open.

254
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:27,160
I don't think they were well enough trained for that. Horses are hard to stop when they move fast en masse.

255
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,200
Probably small groups of knights wheeled up and down these slopes,

256
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,040
eating away at the edge of the shield wall, wearing down Harold's strength.

257
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,880
It was now late afternoon, with dusk coming on fast.

258
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,520
If the Normans were winning, they hadn't yet won.

259
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,360
Harold was still on his feet and his men, although depleted, still held the ridge.

260
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,760
At 7, William turned to his archers,

261
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:06,800
ordering them to shoot high so that their arrows fell over the tattered shield wall onto the men behind it.

262
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,840
If the tapestry is to be believed, one of them hit Harold in the eye.

263
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,400
Some knights forced their way into the knot of housecarls surrounding Harold, and hacked the King to death.

264
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,800
With the King dead, panic swept through the English ranks.

265
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,560
The Bayeux Tapestry tells us simply, "The English fled." Many fyrdmen must indeed have slipped away.

266
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,600
Not so the theyns and housecarls who'd fought all day with Harold.

267
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,200
Like the heroes of epic poems, they remained true to their lord.

268
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,120
Here, on grass already greasy with the blood of the slain,

269
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,960
they swung sword and axe until they too were killed.

270
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,400
There may have been as many as 4,000 dead on this dreadful field.

271
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Although the King's brothers could be identified, Harold could not.

272
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,560
His mistress, Edith Swan Neck, had followed Harold to Hastings and spent the day on Caldbec Hill.

273
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:37,200
As night fell she came up here to Senlac and, with a lover's eye, identified the body she knew so well.

274
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,240
This stone marks the spot where Harold died.

275
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,320
William was reluctant to grant burial in consecrated ground to a man

276
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,440
whose ambition had caused suffering.

277
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,680
But Harold probably lies at Waltham Abbey in Essex.

278
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,720
He was luckier than his followers whose bones whitened where they lay.

279
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:06,200
"They were few in number," wrote a monkish chronicler, "but brave in the extreme."

280
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,240
Soon after Hastings, most of the surviving magnates surrendered

281
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,280
and William advanced on London, crushing resistance as he went.

282
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,800
The Conqueror was crowned King in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066.

283
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,440
Invasion became occupation. The country was carved up among William's followers.

284
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
Hundreds of castles were built to enforce their will.

285
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,440
We're never far from evidence of the Conquest.

286
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,560
There had been few castles here before 1066. The Normans built many.

287
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:51,280
The White Tower in the Tower of London was begun in the Conqueror's reign.

288
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,320
But the Conquest was more than a change of military architecture.

289
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,760
It brought a new language and a new ruling class.

290
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,600
4,000 Saxon theyns were replaced by 200 Norman barons,

291
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,440
whose dominance sneered out from these great square keeps.

292
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,320
Small wonder that a Norse poet wrote:

293
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,160
"Cold heart and bloody hand

294
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,920
"Now rule the English land."

295
