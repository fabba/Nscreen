00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
*

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,640
This ceiling at the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,720
was created by Rubens to celebrate the majesty of monarchy.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,160
A little after 2pm on the 30th of January 1649, Charles I walked through this room.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,600
As he went, he must have reflected on the irony of the image above him.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,120
He descended these stairs,

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,320
then walked through a hole cut in the wall just there

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,840
onto a scaffold draped in black.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,880
After making a short speech which few could hear, he prayed,

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,600
then fell to the ground and put his head on the block.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,680
The headsman's axe severed it with a single blow.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,040
18 miles north of London,

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,520
in a Northamptonshire field,

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,680
Mike Westaway and Peter Burton are tracking the distribution of lead musket balls.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,320
This is the battlefield of Naseby,

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,200
the Civil War's decisive clash.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,480
- HOOT! 
- Got a signal, Pete!

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,520
It was here on the 14th of June, 1645, that Charles lost the war

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,120
and began his long downward slide that ended on a scaffold in Whitehall.

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,160
300 years later, the land yields up its secrets.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,920
- Mike, you'll have to pinpoint this one.
- I'm not entirely convinced.
- Oh, it's there.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,560
- HOOTING 
- It'll be THERE. Right?

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Ah, here we are!

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,400
- You're the first man to touch that since 1645.
- Remarkable!

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,080
Absolutely remarkable! Goodness me... Look at that.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,760
The war may seem remote to us now, but that musket ball is a reminder that men fought and died here

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
in a struggle that was to decide who was to rule the country -

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,240
King or Parliament.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,880
The campaign that ended on Naseby field began 100 miles to the south.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,320
Oxford has been called "the home of lost causes".

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,840
During the Civil War, it was the Royalist capital

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,920
and Charles's Parliament, set up in opposition to the rather larger one at Westminster,

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,560
met here in the Hall at Christchurch.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,600
By the spring of 1645, the war had been going on for almost three years.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,120
It was a deeply divisive conflict,

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,440
pitting family against family, father against son, brother against brother.

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Men fought one another with the firm conviction that God was on their side -

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,600
none more so than Charles himself.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,640
But the tide of war was running hard against the King.

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Many of his advisors believed that now was the time

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,560
 to gain a military advantage which might turn into a compromise peace.

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,640
His nephew, Prince Rupert, a distinguished soldier at 26, commanded the Royalist forces.

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,680
But a recent defeat convinced him that peace must be sought.

44
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,360
George, Lord Digby, courtier and amateur soldier,

45
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
was for engaging the enemy with the help of troops from Ireland.

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,440
Charles himself - chilly, easily influenced, yet immovable on the issue of Royal power -

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
continuously wavered.

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,360
With the King's advisors divided,

49
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,800
we shouldn't be surprised that the 1645 campaign began in an air of uncertainty.

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,840
But it soon developed into a deadly game of cat and mouse.

51
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,880
One May morning, this quadrangle bustled with the activity that precedes a campaign.

52
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,920
Charles left his quarters over there, mounted his horse, and, leaving Oxford well garrisoned,

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,960
set off north with his army, perhaps to join his Scots supporters.

54
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,440
It was a fateful decision.

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Hardly had he left than the Parliamentarians arrived in hot pursuit

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,640
and laid siege to the city.

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,720
They dug gun positions up here on Headington Hill,

58
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,240
with its commanding view of Oxford,

59
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,960
and prepared to bombard the city.

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,560
In command was Sir Thomas Fairfax,

61
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
a 33-year-old peer's son from Yorkshire,

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
whose dark hair and swarthy features earned him the nickname Black Tom.

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,560
Fairfax needed to test Parliament's recently formed New Model Army.

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,960
Its soldiers, many of them conscripts, were promised regular pay and a decent uniform.

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,720
The New Model was untried in battle.

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,760
The Royalists were anxious to draw Fairfax away from Oxford

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:02,520
and they decided that the best way of doing so would be to fall upon some place possessed by Parliament.

68
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,920
They chose Leicester.

69
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,840
The castle and newarke retained their mediaeval stone walls

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,960
and the rest of the town had earth and timber defences.

71
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,560
On the 30th of May, Rupert ordered it to surrender.

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,600
When it refused, the batteries up here opened fire.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,640
By nightfall, they had blown a breach in the walls and Rupert assaulted the city.

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,160
Some of the defenders of Leicester

75
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,200
fired their guns through loop holes cut in the old town walls.

76
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,920
But the attackers had surprises of their own.

77
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,520
Grenados, grenades made of pottery,

78
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,120
were filled with black powder, with powder running down a wooden fuse.

79
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,240
You lit the fuse from a length of slow-burning cord

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
and then threw them over the walls

81
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,440
to cause consternation amongst the inexperienced defenders on the far side.

82
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,640
The outnumbered defenders fought like tigers

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,320
and many townspeople joined in.

84
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,360
This enraged the attackers, who fell upon soldiers and civilians alike.

85
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,440
One Royalist says, "They fired upon our men out of their windows and from the tops of their houses,

86
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,640
"and threw tiles down upon their heads.

87
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,160
"Finding one house better manned than ordinary and many shots fired at us,

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,480
"we resolved to make them an example, which they did -

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,520
"breaking the doors, they killed all they found without distinction."

90
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Once taken, the town was remorselessly pillaged.

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,320
When the Mayor turned out to welcome Charles's formal entry, his silver mace was snatched as he waited.

92
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,840
So great was the carnage

93
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,680
that it is said Charles wept, and ordered a stop to the killing.

94
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,880
Though the fate of Leicester was harsh by the standards of the Civil War,

95
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,960
the line between discipline and obedience was always pretty thin.

96
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,000
Soldiers carried a snapsack - we'd now call it a knapsack - in which to put their daily ration:

97
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
two pounds of bread, a pound of meat or cheese,

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,520
a bottle of wine or two bottles of beer.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,040
Yet the sudden arrival of an army often exhausted local foodstocks.

100
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:49,080
Since soldiers were paid late, if at all, they sometimes existed simply by marauding.

101
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,600
They even ran out of clothes.

102
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,200
A Parliamentarian officer complained that his men had one pair of trousers between two.

103
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,240
When one was on duty, decency compelled the other to remain in bed.

104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,520
Small wonder that men looted when they got the chance.

105
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,360
After Leicester, the Royalists drifted southward to Daventry, not knowing if their strategy had worked.

106
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,480
They spread out over the surrounding area, living off the country.

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,960
On the evening the 12th of June, the King was hunting deer in the park, when he heard good news and bad.

108
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,000
The good news was that the New Model had given up the siege at Oxford.

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,040
The bad news was that it was only a few miles away. His strategy had worked all too well.

110
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,920
Fairfax had been told to abandon the siege of Oxford on the 2nd of June.

111
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,960
He came pounding up here, well aware that the King's Field Army was his real target for the campaign.

112
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,480
He spent the night watching the Royalists,

113
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,520
but when he got back to headquarters, he'd forgotten the password

114
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,480
and the sentry kept him outside until the Captain of the Guard came to identify him.

115
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,840
And it's a measure of Fairfax that he gave the sentry a coin for his soldierly honesty.

116
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,400
On the night of June 13th, 1645,

117
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,400
some Royalist cavalrymen, dining at this table in Shuckborough Hall in Naseby,

118
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,040
were surprised and captured.

119
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,080
A few got away and galloped off north to Market Harborough -

120
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,120
Prince Rupert's headquarters after the long day's march from Daventry.

121
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,200
The Royalists held a Council of War there in the small hours.

122
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,240
Rupert and most senior officers probably advised marching north.

123
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,080
They knew they were outnumbered and they had a healthy respect for the New Model,

124
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,120
which Digby and his cronies scornfully called "The New Noddle".

125
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,880
The King, as usual, was undecided, but eventually he sided with Digby.

126
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,760
His army would offer battle.

127
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,680
The Royalists left Market Harborough - behind me - at dawn on the 14th.

128
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,120
They marched up here to take position on what one officer called "rising ground of great advantage"

129
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,960
and waited for the New Model to appear from the direction of Naseby.

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,480
Unfortunately, it didn't.

131
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,600
And Francis Ruce, the Scoutmaster-General, was sent off in search of it.

132
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,640
He was soon back with the news that it was nowhere to be found.

133
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,360
Rupert was unimpressed. If the New Model wasn't about, who pushed in his patrols last night?

134
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,400
So he set off down there, with a strong advance guard, to find it.

135
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,320
Rupert was right. The Parliamentarians had not gone away.

136
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,360
From their vantage point to the north-east of Naseby, they watched the Royalist column move off

137
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,400
and shadowed it across a landscape of unenclosed expanses of rough grassland,

138
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,680
interspersed with gorse and boggy ground.

139
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Like two wrestlers, circling,

140
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
looking for an advantage,

141
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,680
the armies moved westwards, seeking better ground.

142
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,520
The Royalists marched between Sibbertoft and Clipston

143
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,640
onto Dust Hill, where the Royal Standard now flies.

144
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,160
The New Model had less far to come

145
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,320
and it finished up on Mill Hill, behind me.

146
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,360
Between the two armies lay Broad Moor, a great open plain.

147
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,480
This near-contemporary engraving gives a very good view of the opposing forces.

148
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,520
In the 17th century, armies faced each other in strict formation -

149
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,040
cavalry opposite cavalry on the wings,

150
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,120
and infantry, made up of blocks of pike and musket, in the middle.

151
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,720
Fairfax had about 16,000 men -

152
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,240
some in the infantry, a bit shaky,

153
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,440
others very good - especially the cavalry, under Cromwell.

154
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,960
There were about 12,000 Royalists on the ridge opposite.

155
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Sir Marmaduke Langdale -

156
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,560
a Yorkshireman so dour that when he was at the point of death, nobody dared tell him -

157
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,520
commanded the cavalry on the Royalist left.

158
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:22,880
In the centre, Lord Astley, a professional soldier in his sixties, commanded the Royalist infantry.

159
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,360
Very good, this - the King's old foot, with a high proportion of experienced officers.

160
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,400
On the right was Prince Rupert with some of his best cavalry regiments.

161
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,440
And it was on this flank that the first of the action took place.

162
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,480
Colonel John Okey was one of the New Model's new men.

163
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,280
He was a stocky, tough soldier with a taste for Republican politics, and a devout Puritan.

164
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,760
He was issuing ammunition

165
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,800
when Cromwell ordered him forward to secure the hedges on the New Model's left flank.

166
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
Okey's men lined these at right angles to Rupert's cavalry.

167
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,720
The Royalists saw that they were in a position to do great damage to their horse as they passed by

168
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,240
so they strived to flush them out.

169
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,920
At this period, dragoons were really mounted infantry.

170
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,560
They could fight on horseback if they had to,

171
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,600
but their mounts were cheap nags, smaller than proper cavalry chargers.

172
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,640
They carried a flintlock musket, and when they dismounted, they left one man in ten to hold the horses.

173
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,640
The Battle of Naseby began just here,

174
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,000
with the Royalists hemming Okey in on three sides.

175
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,040
He received them, as he put it, "with shooting and rejoicing,

176
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:57,320
"but it pleased God that we beat them off, both horse and foot, and kept our ground."

177
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,720
It wasn't really in Rupert's interests to attack first.

178
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,320
He'd have to come past Okey's dragoons and then up a slope to get at Ireton's men.

179
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,800
But he wasn't one to hang about.

180
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,000
When the armies were formed up, he led his cavalry forward, past the dragoons, who hit him in the flank.

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,480
He paused briefly about here - probably a combination of a parish hedge and boggy ground -

182
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,040
and then he was off.

183
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,160
Rupert's men would have ridden three-deep, knee to knee.

184
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,000
They'd have started at a walk, then broken into a trot,

185
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,040
and at about 60 paces from the enemy line, into a gallop.

186
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,080
Fairfax's cavalry came down the slope to meet him and fought hard.

187
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,120
But before long, Rupert was through, riding with loose rein and bloody spur

188
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,680
into the open country beyond.

189
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,280
At the same moment as Rupert charged, the Royalist Infantry advanced.

190
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,280
They came up this slope, as Cromwell admitted, "in gallant order"

191
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,840
and as they crested the rise, they saw the New Model's infantry drawn up just in front of them.

192
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,880
It must have been an unnerving sight, but these were hard men.

193
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,800
Present! Your places! Cock your match!

194
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,720
First to engage were the musketeers.

195
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,720
There was an exchange of volley fire

196
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,560
at close range.

197
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,040
Aim... Fire!

198
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,320
- Mick, this is the matchlock musket used by the foot on both sides.
- Yes.

199
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,680
By Naseby, two-thirds of the foot on both sides had matchlock muskets.

200
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,120
- How do you work it?
- Well, we open the pan, take the priming flask...

201
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,240
we prime the pan, we close the pan,

202
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,800
shake off loose powder, blow off loose powder...

203
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,680
- take a measured charge out of one of these holders... 
- How much powder?

204
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,760
About three drams. We take some wadding...

205
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,600
We draw the scouring stick...

206
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,320
ram home the wad,

207
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,960
replace the scouring stick...

208
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,680
take a ball, put a ball in...

209
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
We then mount the match,

210
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,320
blow on your coals...

211
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,600
test the match...

212
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,280
adjust it to fall in the pan.

213
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Then we present and give fire.

214
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,360
- Recover.
- How many could you fire in a minute?
- Two to three rounds.

215
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:31,000
- A good musketeer might manage three. 
- You had to know your business. 
- Absolutely.

216
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,480
The musket was a grubby affair, with plenty of opportunities for burnt fingers and a singed moustache.

217
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,520
Men also needed to master collective drills.

218
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,560
"Firing by introduction" allowed them to achieve a continuous fire.

219
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:57,800
As the line advanced, the front rank fired, to be immediately replaced by a succession of ranks from the rear.

220
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,960
Mike and Peter's harvest is a poignant one.

221
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,120
Here's a good cross-section of artefacts from Naseby field.

222
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,400
A belt buckle,

223
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,880
that's a spur buckle

224
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,400
 and these are various strap buckles.

225
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,440
A horse harness buckle, found in a concentration of bullets,

226
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,000
and of course bullets themselves.

227
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,920
That bullet obviously hit something very hard

228
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,480
and one would assume it was armour.

229
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,640
- And flattened right out.
- Yes. Indeed.

230
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,560
- This really enables you to touch the past, doesn't it?
- It's real history.

231
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,120
A third of the infantry carried the pike.

232
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,800
It was meant to be 18 feet long,

233
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,400
but soldiers, understandably enough, often shortened it for convenience.

234
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,440
Pikemen would have advanced with their weapons at the shoulder

235
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,480
and then, before contact brought them down to the charge,

236
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,920
for that ghastly business called "push of pike".

237
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,800
- Pike!
- ARGGH!

238
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,400
After an hour of fighting, the Royalist infantry had the upper hand.

239
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,240
But victory proved elusive.

240
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,520
While Rupert won the cavalry battle on the New Model's left, Cromwell did exactly the same on the right.

241
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,560
Many of Rupert's men went in search of fleeing Parliamentarians,

242
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,120
while Cromwell swung his uncommitted regiments against the rear of the hitherto unbeaten Royalist Infantry.

243
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,800
It was the battle's decisive moment.

244
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,880
Vainly, the Royalists fought back.

245
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,360
But they must have been asking the question that we still ask today.

246
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,000
Where was Rupert?

247
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,520
The New Model's baggage train

248
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,160
stood somewhere here with its guard.

249
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,880
A party of cavalry approached, led by an officer in a red montero cap

250
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,000
just like the one that Fairfax had worn before he put his helmet on that morning.

251
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,480
Thinking it was his general, the Guard Commander approached, doffed his hat and asked how the day went.

252
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,920
He was shocked to be invited to surrender. It was Rupert himself.

253
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,680
The Guard fired and beat the Royalists off

254
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,360
but by the time Rupert got his men back to the battlefield, the day was lost.

255
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,560
Charles I was no coward.

256
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,600
On the chilly morning of his execution,

257
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,640
he deliberately donned two shirts lest any shivering be misunderstood.

258
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,680
As the tide of battle turned against him,

259
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,720
he prepared to lead his last reserve forward, into the valley down there.

260
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,480
However, the Earl of Carneth, who rode alongside him, uttered some Scots oaths and grabbed his bridle.

261
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,640
As the King's horse turned, there was something like a panic in the cavalry surrounding him.

262
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,680
The whole lot, we are told, "turned their horses and rode upon the spur

263
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,360
"as if they were, every man, to shift for himself."

264
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,520
The Parliamentarian propagandists were quick to talk of a Royalist rout,

265
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,040
but the new archaeological finds

266
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,080
suggest otherwise.

267
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,120
 Historian Glenn Foard has reassessed the evidence.

268
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,240
Glenn, I always thought, once the King failed to lead that last charge,

269
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,400
- the battle was over very quickly. 
- That has been the understanding.

270
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,560
But the new archaeological evidence has really turned the tables.

271
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,600
That low hill in the distance is the site where the King's infantry was destroyed.

272
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,680
That hill is LITTERED with musket balls.

273
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,720
That distance - two miles from the battlefield as we have known it -

274
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,760
made one ask some questions about the interpretation of the battle.

275
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,800
It's made me look back at the documentary evidence -

276
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,840
the accounts of the battle and the topography of the landscape.

277
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,880
And those accounts can be tied into this archaeological evidence,

278
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,080
suggesting the retreat was over two miles back to Wadborough Hill

279
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,360
and it's on that hill that the King's old infantry were destroyed.

280
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,400
The King himself perhaps stood even here, with his cavalry, watching that destruction,

281
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,800
- wondering how he would follow on. 
- And knowing that it was the end of the war as far as he was concerned?

282
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,320
That really was the end of the war.

283
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,360
Although he was able to pull together most of his cavalry,

284
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,400
although they got back to Leicester from here in dribs and drabs,

285
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,360
the loss of his old Infantry on that hill was the end of the war.

286
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,440
The pursuing Parliamentarians weren't simply intent on plunder.

287
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Hereabouts, they found some women from the Royalist baggage train.

288
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,880
Contemporaries called them "Irish women, wives of the bloody rebels in Ireland" and "common rabble."

289
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,200
Some carried long knives and spoke a language that the Parliamentarians couldn't understand.

290
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,680
About a hundred were killed,

291
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:05,840
and the rest marked as whores by having their faces slashed or their noses slit.

292
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,000
It's almost certain that the women were neither Irish nor whores,

293
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,800
but the wives of the King's Welsh Infantry.

294
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,480
There were fewer killed than we might expect for such a hard-fought battle, perhaps 1,500 in all.

295
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,880
Naseby destroyed the King's last good army.

296
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,920
Though the war went on, its issue was never again in doubt.

297
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,960
Almost as damaging was the capture of all Charles's private papers.

298
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,400
Amongst them was a letter to the Queen in which he describes a plan

299
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,160
to bring the Irish to fight for him.

300
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,200
It was damning evidence used against him at his trial.

301
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,080
After the war it was Cromwell, not Fairfax, who dominated the political scene.

302
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,560
But a long-term settlement eluded him

303
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,640
and in 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne.

304
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,560
Yet it wasn't his father's throne, built on divine right -

305
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,560
but a throne resting firmly on Parliament.

306
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,000
Naseby, in its way, had changed history.
