1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
*

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,360
His helmet encircled with the golden crown,

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,880
Richard III, King of England, prepared himself for ordeal by battle.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,960
He rode out against the man who had vowed to wrest the crown from his head

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,880
and sought to kill him in hand-to-hand combat.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,840
That spectacular flourish took place here on the 22nd of August, 1485.

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,400
These fields, just west of Leicester, near the little town of Market Bosworth,

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,920
saw the last battle of the Wars of the Roses, that bloody clash between the Houses of York and Lancaster.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,120
Richard's supporters had advised him to flee. He declined, retorting,

10
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,120
"This day will I die as a King or win."

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,680
It was a heroic gesture, far removed from the sneering villain of Shakespeare's play.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,160
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was a capable, energetic man.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,200
He was a brave soldier and popular commander.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,160
He spent much of his time in the north,

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,200
which he successfully ruled for his brother, the Yorkist king, Edward IV.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,240
Edward, son of the Duke of York, had defeated Lancastrian rivals and secured the crown. The opening words

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,800
of Shakespeare's Richard III evoked the mood of the time:

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,120
"Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,680
"By this sun of York."

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,200
But it was by no means a cloudless sky. As the story unfolds, we find a plot as murky

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,720
as anything in Shakespeare. On Edward IV's death,

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,280
his 12-year-old son succeeded to the throne as Edward V.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,320
His uncle Richard was appointed Protector until the boy came of age.

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,360
The young King and his brother were lodged here in the Tower of London.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,880
In those days, the Tower wasn't just a prison, but the official royal residence in the city of London.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,440
The two young princes were looked after comfortably here in the royal apartments.

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,480
Days before Edward's coronation, they were accused of being illegitimate.

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,280
They couldn't succeed to the throne and Richard was invited to do so.

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,240
In the weeks that followed, the princes were seen less and less in the Tower grounds.

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,600
One day they disappeared altogether.

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,640
In the 17th century, two bodies were found here behind this staircase.

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Were they the skeletons of the princes? Did Richard murder them or had servants done so on his behalf?

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,040
The surviving evidence wouldn't convict Richard of complicity in their deaths,

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,080
but he stood to gain by the demise of his nephews.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Even today, it's a sensitive subject.

36
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,040
There are people here

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,080
that visit the Tower, some come purposely to see the bloody Tower.

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,640
They feel strongly if we suggest Richard was responsible for their deaths.

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
They jump on us with vengeance

40
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,520
and it's difficult to defend yourself when talking to a large crowd.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,440
Whatever the truth, suspicion undermined the rightness of Richard's cause.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,480
His seizure of power opened old wounds.

43
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,520
Discontented factions looked once more to the rival House of Lancaster.

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:21,560
The spectre of bloody feud now threatened the peace Edward IV had brought to the country.

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,840
The anti-Richard party turned to the Lancastrian claimant - Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond,

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,360
grandson of a marriage between the widow of Henry V and a Welsh gentleman, Owen Tudor.

47
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,360
The French King and the Duke of Brittany had given Henry a place of refuge for most of his life.

48
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,160
And it was from across the Channel that he laid claim to the crown of England

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,960
on Christmas Day, 1483.

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,000
He was 26 years old and had few adherents, but he was determined to reach for the crown.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,560
The long road to Bosworth had begun.

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,600
By 1485, Richard's position had worsened.

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,640
He was over-reliant on advisers like Sir Richard Radcliff, Sir William Catesby and Francis, Lord Lovell.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,200
A piece of contemporary doggerel linked them to the King's white boar badge.

55
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,680
"The cat, the rat and Lovell the dog rule all England under the hog."

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,720
As Richard took up residence at Nottingham, it was not the hog that best described him,

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,000
but the spider on his web - well-placed to pounce

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,560
on the Welsh upstart.

59
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,600
On the 1st of August, 1485, Henry Tudor assembled his forces at the mouth of the Seine.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,640
He set sail from Harfleur in a small flotilla funded by the French King.

61
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,880
A week later, after carefully skirting the coast of England,

62
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
he landed at Milford Haven in Wales.

63
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,000
It was a foreign invasion.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,040
Apart from a small group of English exiles, Henry's army consisted of 2,000 French mercenaries.

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,680
His choice of Wales

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,240
should come as no surprise.

67
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Although the country had lost its independence, its sense of national identity remained very strong.

68
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:40,280
Henry was proud of his Welsh roots and hoped to encourage powerful Welsh contingents to his standard.

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,800
A week's march across mid-Wales brought him to the borders of England.

70
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,080
Henry had decided to cross the River Severn

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,120
here at Shrewsbury and demanded the town's surrender.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,160
The local bailiff, Thomas Mitton, had sworn that Henry would only enter over his dead body.

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,680
When the townspeople opened the gates, Mitton lay down and feigned death

74
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,240
and Henry's horse walked over him.

75
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,000
This may be a tall story, but most people would join what looked like the winning side.

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Having got to England,

77
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Henry now considered his next move.

78
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,400
He spent the night here while he debated his plans.

79
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
He could either head for London

80
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,040
or try to attract the private armies of those families not committed to Richard.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,440
Most likely to join him were the Stanleys whose power base lay in North Wales and Lancashire.

82
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,480
Power broking in England at this time was in the hands of the great feudal dynasties.

83
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Kings ruled only with the support of these families and their armies. Allegiances would shift.

84
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,120
The Stanleys were outwardly loyal to Richard, but were hedging their bets by maintaining contact with Henry.

85
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,600
Their role was to prove crucial over the next few days.

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Henry raised his red dragon standard and went east.

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,080
He kept open his line of retreat into Wales, while moving closer to the Stanleys.

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,840
There were two Stanleyite armies - one under Thomas, Lord Stanley,

89
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,880
the other under his brother, Sir William. Lord Stanley just happened to be Henry's stepfather.

90
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,920
The dragon, the hart and the white boar were on a collision course

91
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,480
that would end on Bosworth Field.

92
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,160
In a secluded vale near Merevale Abbey,

93
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,680
Lord Stanley rode in for a secret meeting with Henry.

94
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,720
We can't be sure what passed between the two men,

95
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,280
but Henry agreed to offer battle the next day, confident the Stanleys would support him.

96
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,920
This support was far from certain as Richard held Stanley's son

97
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
as hostage for his father's good behaviour.

98
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,120
Henry only had 5,000 men and knew that Richard would command far more.

99
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,160
Without the Stanleys, he had little chance of winning any battle.

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
Richard had indeed got his superior army, in numbers at least.

101
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,560
On hearing of Henry's movements, he marched from Nottingham to Leicester where he assembled his army.

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,600
On Sunday, the 21st of August, he led more than 10,000 men across this bridge towards Bosworth.

103
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,640
As he crossed, his spur struck against the stone.

104
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,680
We are told that one of those wise women who always seem to be on hand

105
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,720
warned that this was where his head would be broken.

106
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
Scarcely an encouraging prophecy.

107
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,800
Richard was an experienced commander who helped beat the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury 14 years before.

108
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,360
And he chose this rising ground just south of Market Bosworth to deploy his army.

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,920
It gave him a good view of the surrounding countryside and the movements of his enemy.

110
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,480
It was a strong position and he had the bigger army, but he was clearly a worried man.

111
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
Richard camped for the night

112
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,480
near Sutton Cheney within striking distance of his opponent.

113
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,520
It is said that he spent a troubled night.

114
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,000
Was it a guilty conscience or concern about desertions

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,680
and the loyalty of those who had sworn allegiance to him, especially the Stanleys?

116
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,440
It is said that just before the battle, Richard heard Mass here in Sutton Cheney church.

117
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:51,960
He was a devout man, and as he prayed, he must have hoped the Lord would protect him from treachery.

118
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
He knew he had the superior force, but did he have the hearts of men?

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,720
Betrayal was his greatest fear, yet he was committed to fighting, whatever the risk.

120
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,000
In Sutton Cheney today,

121
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,720
there's a lot of sympathy amongst the villagers for Richard.

122
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,280
I feel that Shakespeare did a lot of bad for him,

123
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,160
but I don't think he was that bad a man.

124
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:30,120
People around here are more for Richard because of the local connections.

125
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,960
He was around Leicester and also Warwick, so therefore people around this area, it was close...

126
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,200
- He's a bit of a local hero? 
- That's right, yes.

127
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,360
The church has become something of a shrine.

128
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,400
People pay their respects to the man they see as the victim of Shakespearean misrepresentation.

129
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,440
I got around to reading a prayer of King Richard's.

130
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,480
Anyone who can write as profoundly as that...

131
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,520
Basically a Christian man couldn't possibly have done those deeds.

132
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm certain of it.

133
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,240
So you think that he was a good man who has been misjudged by history?

134
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,760
Exactly. And if he was physically handicapped, in those days that was enough to condemn anyone.

135
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,400
But, um... I don't believe that he was the bad man that he was painted.

136
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,520
I think it's just a prayerful place.

137
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,760
And he probably found that, if he was a pious man, that was the place to be

138
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
a short while before the battle.

139
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,240
It's almost never easy to be absolutely sure of the location of a medieval battle.

140
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,280
In the case of Bosworth, although contemporary accounts speak of a battle in Redmore Plain,

141
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,160
that place name no longer survives. The landscape has changed.

142
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,520
There are more hedges and the Victorians built this railway line

143
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,080
across part of the site.

144
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,760
Happily, it now has its terminus at the point where Henry lined up his troops

145
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,320
to confront Richard's forces up there on Ambion Hill.

146
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,960
At 5.15 that morning, as the sun rose,

147
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:53,480
Richard drew the whole of his army out of their encampments and arrayed his battle line to face the enemy.

148
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,520
We can't be sure of the exact position of the rival armies,

149
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,560
but the Stanleys were on the sideline when battle commenced.

150
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,600
The Bosworth Visitors' Centre puts Richard here on Ambion Hill,

151
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,160
Henry down there at its foot

152
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,880
and the Stanleys over there able to intervene on either side.

153
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,520
The two armies manoeuvred into battle formation.

154
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,320
They drew up in lines facing each other - tightly packed

155
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,840
because of the cramped contours of the hill.

156
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,320
Richard, King of England!

157
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,880
The rival commanders were experienced. The blue boar of the Earl of Oxford led Henry's vanguard.

158
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,680
The King's trusted commander was John Howard, Duke of Norfolk.

159
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,200
Richard himself sat on the crest and watched anxiously.

160
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:10,840
If he trusted Norfolk, he was not sure of the Earl of Northumberland who commanded the reserves.

161
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,320
DEATH TO THE TRAITOR, RICHARD!

162
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,040
First to engage were the archers, ranks of longbowmen

163
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,080
who sent a withering rain of arrows down on their enemy.

164
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,400
But the longbow was not the winner

165
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,880
it had been at Agincourt. Both sides had them in numbers, and except at close range,

166
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,080
they were unlikely to penetrate plate armour.

167
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:51,680
- More deadly in this respect was the crossbow. 
- This is a 15th-century crossbow.

168
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,320
This attachment at the top is a windlass.

169
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,760
It operates pulleys at the bottom which were attached to the string.

170
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,120
What happens is, as I turn it,

171
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,480
the pulley system allows the string to be drawn up towards the nut where it's held.

172
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,600
It's not taking much pressure

173
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,480
for me to draw this up.

174
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,640
The back has a lever

175
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,560
and that locks this nut in position.

176
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,400
And this allows me then

177
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,960
to loosen off the pulley system.

178
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,040
And the pulley system actually comes right off.

179
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,080
Now you're in position to put a bolt on.

180
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
These bolts have leather fletchings.

181
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
Why leather rather than feathers?

182
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,880
The power which the crossbow produces,

183
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,560
it folds back feathers and this makes the bolt spin out of control. The advantage of the crossbow

184
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,120
is that it can be held in one position while it is loaded until it's ready to fire.

185
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,640
With a longbow, you would have to stand up, draw and then fire, so there's a difference in the time.

186
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,200
The disadvantage is that it takes so long to fire that 15 or 16 arrows could be shot in the time

187
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,200
that it takes one crossbowman to load and fire.

188
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,360
But if the bow was on the way out, another form of firepower was making its early appearance.

189
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,680
These stone cannonballs were found at Bosworth. They're evidence

190
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,720
that if much that happened wouldn't have shocked the men who fought at Hastings 400 years before,

191
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,760
in one respect war had moved on.

192
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,400
Into the stench of blood, sweat and ordure

193
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
was now laced the bad-egg stink of black powder.

194
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,560
This early breech-loader could smash bones. It may not have been accurate, but it was noisy.

195
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,520
And a mass target didn't require precision.

196
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,280
The two lines of infantry moved steadily towards each other.

197
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,280
The impetus of Richard's downhill charge failed to push the enemy back.

198
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,480
Oxford held his line. This led to an hour of bitter hand-to-hand fighting.

199
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Medieval battle is well summed up

200
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,880
as bloody murder. Many of the infantrymen on both sides would have carried weapons like this.

201
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,760
It's called a bill. It can stab, hack or drag a horseman from his charger.

202
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,320
It might have started life as an agricultural implement and it's cheap and nasty.

203
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,200
This is an up-market version - a poleaxe, used by men-at-arms on foot.

204
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,960
It can cut, stab and this is designed

205
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
to break armour by sheer physical impact.

206
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,440
It was a time to settle old scores.

207
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,040
Personal enemies sought each other out and engaged in hand-to-hand duels.

208
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,080
Richard had his own grudge.

209
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,000
Furious that the Stanleys sat in the wings, he ordered the beheading of Lord Stanley's son,

210
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,560
whom he held as hostage.

211
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,200
Richard's order was never carried out,

212
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,680
perhaps through confusion, but more likely because his men were hedging their bets.

213
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,000
In armour weighing seven stone, men were quickly exhausted

214
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,520
and commanders needed to bring up reserves of fresh men.

215
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,320
Unfortunately for Richard, his rearguard under Northumberland

216
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,360
displayed what has been described as "masterly reluctance to intervene".

217
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,040
Battles at this time

218
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,200
were rarely fought to the bitter end. With the King making little progress,

219
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,240
his men, it is said, broke off from their fighting for a little while,

220
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,760
and there are suggestions that some of them, their hearts never really in the battle, began to slip away.

221
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,480
With the battle turning against him, Richard's companions urged him to flee. He would have none of it.

222
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,000
Then from his vantage point up here, he saw Henry with a small escort ride round to their left flank,

223
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,560
perhaps to confer with the Stanleys.

224
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,600
If he could kill Henry in single combat, the battle might yet be won.

225
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,480
Richard, fired by anger, charged out of the side of his line of battle

226
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,000
towards him.

227
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Even those who had no love for Richard, or who wrote when Henry or his descendants were on the throne,

228
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,120
cannot deny Richard the glory of his last moments. At full charge, he headed straight for Henry.

229
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,160
To his opponents, he was a formidable sight.

230
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,600
With the point of his lance, he transfixed Sir William Brandon, Henry's standard-bearer.

231
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,640
Then with sword or battle-axe, he hacked his way towards the Pretender and nearly reached him.

232
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,200
At the critical moment,

233
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,240
the Stanleys threw in their lot with Henry.

234
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,840
Sir William Stanley with a force of 5,000 men plunged into Richard's escort with the war cry, "Stanley!"

235
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,880
Lord Stanley remained behind and didn't take part in the fighting,

236
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,280
but Sir William's intervention was decisive.

237
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,720
Richard's position was hopeless. He lost his horse,

238
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,280
possibly in this boggy ground, and his companions offered him another to escape on.

239
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,320
He refused, and as a contemporary tells us, "He was pitifully slain,

240
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,880
"fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies."

241
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,400
This memorial marks a possible spot where he fell and was hacked to death as he writhed on the ground,

242
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,960
last of the Plantagenets.

243
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,840
It was probably on this hill at Stoke Golding, overlooking part of the battlefield,

244
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,400
that Henry thanked his comrades-in-arms and had the crown placed on his head.

245
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,560
Even today, it's still called Crown Hill.

246
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,040
Those present were seeing the beginning of one of the most successful dynasties

247
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,600
 in English history - the Tudors.

248
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,600
And what of Richard? His body was brought back to Leicester

249
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,160
slung across a packhorse.

250
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,200
It is said that his head hit the same stone that his spur had clipped on his way to Bosworth.

251
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,240
Richard was stripped of the dignity of kingship.

252
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,280
His naked body, spattered with blood and mire, was put on public display

253
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,120
before being buried in a nearby Franciscan friary.

254
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,160
Going back to the quincentenary in 1985, a family visited a week after that.

255
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,200
I said, "Why didn't you come last week?"

256
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,760
 "We daren't. Our name's Stanley!"

257
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,920
Henry was the victor and history was written by his apologists,

258
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,480
but we love an underdog, and Richard still lives in people's imagination, while Henry is largely forgotten.

259
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,040
There are no statues of Henry,

260
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,560
but here in Leicester, this striking figure of Richard proclaims his last act of defiant chivalry

261
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
on Bosworth Field.

262
