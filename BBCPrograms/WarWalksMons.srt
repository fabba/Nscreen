1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,040
In August 1914, the "war to end all wars"

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,080
blazed through Belgium and northern France.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,120
Over the next few months, an old world of swords, lances and bugles

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,840
would be shattered by the machine gun and the howitzer.

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Most of the British troops in the first battles in the Great War

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,320
would not survive this new age of industrialised slaughter.

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,720
In the first few days of the campaign,

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,240
they marched across a landscape

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,440
that previous generations of British soldiers knew.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,360
Here at the battlefield of Malplaquet,

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,720
in 1709, the Duke of Malborough won his bloodiest victory.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,120
The smoky carnage of the battles of the horse and musket era

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,160
must have seemed a world away to the schoolboys of Edwardian England.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,920
But in 1914, the British Expeditionary Force

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
marched past this very spot.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,880
Two regiments even spent the night overlooking the battlefield

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
where their ancestors had fallen.

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,400
The British were moving up on the left of their French ally

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,040
in an offensive intended to win the war at a stroke.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,880
In fact, they found themselves squarely in the path of German armies

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,120
pouring down through Belgium.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,080
This monkey, his head rubbed smooth by countless hands for good luck,

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,800
sits at the crossroads of military history.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
We're in the town of Mons,

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,120
now in southern Belgium, but for centuries a border garrison town.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,840
That character is still called the Guard Room Monkey.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,360
In the Middle Ages, Mons was famous for textiles.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,400
But early this century, it was the capital of Belgium's Black Country.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,680
Mons was fought through rather than fought over.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Its centre would still be recognisable

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,720
to the men in the British Expeditionary Force.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,040
Their mobilisation had been a weird parody of a summer holiday:

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,880
a train journey and a walk in the country.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,240
The men who came here in 1914 expected a war of movement

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,320
which would be over by Christmas.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,080
It would be won by guts and determination.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,960
A British training pamphlet declares, "The object of infantry

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,760
"in the attack is to get too close quarters as quickly as possible.

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,240
"During the delivery of the assault the men will cheer.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,040
"Bugles will be sounded and pipes played."

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,240
The soldiers who reached Mons on the 22nd August, 1914,

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,280
were footsore and weary after marching up

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,520
from their concentration area south of the French border

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,400
and gladly rested in the Grand Place.

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,440
But they were advancing against an enemy they believed was in trouble.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,000
They were greeted as heroes by the local population,

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,040
which pressed food and wine on them, sometimes in unwise quantities.

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,200
The soldiers here were from 4th Royal Fusiliers.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,560
They didn't know that only a few miles away,

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,600
tens of thousands of Germans were swinging down on them like a mallet.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,160
Nor did they know that within 24 hours,

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,640
many of them would be wounded or dead.

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,800
As the church bells rang out over Mons

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,280
on Sunday, 23rd of August,

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,680
they might have been sounding the death knell

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,320
for a world that was coming to the end of the line.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Two miles north of Mons is the tiny railway station of Obourg,

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
sitting alongside the Mons-Conde canal.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,560
On the 23rd of August, the British held the canal

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,360
and early that morning,

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
German cavalry scouts appeared on the far bank

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
with infantry and guns close behind them.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
The canal was an effective barrier

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,800
behind which the British could hold off the Germans for a time.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,320
The fighting here was really vicious.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Although the Germans couldn't get across the canal,

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,040
just behind me, they were able to work across the open country

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,360
and come up into the Middlesex flank.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,400
The soldiers fought on desperately though their commander was killed.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,000
They got through and an unknown hero climbed onto the station roof

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,920
and kept the Germans back - he was eventually killed.

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,960
I come here often, but it never fails to move me.

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,400
When the station was demolished in 1981,

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
the Belgians left a bit of wall

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
commemorating that unknown Tom, Dick or Harry,

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,240
who gave his life defending his mates.

77
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,160
# Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag... #

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,200
The British Expeditionary Force was a musical army.

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Its songs were the real soundtrack of that summer.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,400
# What's the use of worrying? It never... #

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,680
A short walk along the canal

82
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,440
takes us to the next village westwards, Nimy.

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
# And smile, smile, smile! #

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,960
We've walked up the canal to the railway bridge at Nimy

85
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,520
and the next battalion along, 4th Royal Fusiliers.

86
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,560
The canal then was a bit narrower and there was a swing bridge

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,160
in place of that ugly concrete monstrosity.

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,080
Most of the men up here were Londoners,

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
reservists called back to the colours on the outbreak of war -

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
big black moustaches and a knowing eye for a mademoiselle.

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
The battalion's two machine guns were just up here,

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
like pimples on the chin of the British position.

93
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,920
They were commanded by Lt Maurice Dease,

94
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,640
an Irishman from County Mayo.

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,240
The machine gunners were an obvious target for German artillery

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,160
and soon they were all killed or wounded.

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,720
Dease himself was hit several times.

98
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Then Private Sid Godley of the rifle company

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,960
admitted to knowing how to work one of these.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,000
He came up here, dragged the dead and wounded to one side,

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,120
and kept firing till his friends had left and he was out of ammunition.

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,200
Then he smashed it on the bridge, threw it into the canal,

103
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,720
and skulked off into Nimy, bleeding profusely.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,800
Dease and Godley were awarded the war's first two Victoria Crosses.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Dease died of his wounds and is buried nearby.

106
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,800
Godley survived in a POW camp.

107
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,160
His mates remembered him as an unlikely hero -

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,000
dour and inclined to be dangerous in a barrack room.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,040
But then, heroes are like that sometimes.

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,000
As the day went on, the German attack

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
spread down the line of the canal.

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,160
It was brought to a dead stop by this, the Enfield rifle,

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,360
in the hands of men who knew how to use it.

114
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,400
They'd shot for their pay. Being a marksman brought you extra money -

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,440
for the wet canteen or for a tart to put a little comfort into soldiering.

116
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,480
These were not men given to great reflections on right or wrong.

117
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,280
They were hard men and, frankly, a lot of them enjoyed it.

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,280
This is an account by John Lucy of the Royal Irish Rifles.

119
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,360
"Our rapid fire was appalling even to us.

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,840
"The worst marksman could not miss.

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,400
"We had only to fire into the brown of the masses of the enemy,

122
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,480
"who, on the fronts of our two companies,

123
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,000
"were continually and uselessly reinforced

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,280
"at the short range of 300 yards.

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,200
"Such tactics amazed us and, after the first shock

126
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,120
"of seeing men helplessly falling as they were hit,

127
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,000
"gave us a great sense of power and pleasure."

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,800
# It's a long way to Tipperary

129
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,840
# It's a long way to go

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,880
# It's a long way to Tipperary

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,240
# To the sweetest girl I know! Goodbye, Piccadilly... #

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,280
British units were strung out along the length of the canal.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,360
As the day went on, the German attack spread to the west.

134
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,840
The British line was over by that unmilitary-looking service station.

135
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,760
It was being attacked by 12th Brandenburg Grenadiers.

136
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
One commander was a 46-year-old reserve officer called Walter Bloem.

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
He'd been snatched from a comfortable literary existence

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
to meet the demands of what he called The Tear Season.

139
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,120
Bloem's first problem was getting his company across this field

140
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
under heavy fire.

141
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,560
Bloem and his company headquarters got to about here,

142
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,640
where there was enough of a bank to keep that rifle-fire off them.

143
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,840
He then saw a corporal, a gentleman ranker he hadn't previously noticed,

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
offer a bottle of champagne to one of his officers.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
The four of them, Bloem,

146
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,440
his orderly, the corporal and the lieutenant, finished the bottle.

147
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,720
How useful a sharpener is to men in that desperate situation.

148
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
No less useful to me!

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,240
When the bottle was finished, Bloem got his company together

150
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,840
for the last rush.

151
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,720
We'll let him take us over the top.

152
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,160
"The enemy must have been waiting to get us all together at close range,

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,000
"for immediately the line rose,

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,280
"it was as if the hounds of hell had been loosed at us,

155
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,320
"as a mass of lead swept in amongst us.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,200
"'Graser!' I called out. No answer. "Where's Lt Graser?"

157
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,760
"And then, from amongst the cries and groans all round

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,960
"came a low-voiced reply.

159
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,240
"'Lt Graser is dead, sir, just this moment.

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,360
"'Shot through the head and heart as he fell. He's here.'

161
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,600
"'Within seconds, almost all this convivial little group

162
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,840
"'had been killed or wounded.'"

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
Although their line held,

164
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,800
the British realised that by staying put, they risked encirclement,

165
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,120
as the Germans pushed past on both flanks.

166
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,040
A little force of Norfolks and Cheshires

167
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,160
was left near the village of Elouges to cover the retreat.

168
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,600
They even gave a last hurrah, a cavalry charge.

169
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,720
The cavalry charged down the line of this Roman road,

170
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,640
4th Dragoon Guards on the left, 9th Lancers on the right.

171
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,720
The Lancers were commanded by Col David Campbell,

172
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
a flamboyant character who had won the Grand National on his horse Sora,

173
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
and was inevitably nicknamed Sora Campbell.

174
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,200
And see what the Lancers carried under the arm at the engage.

175
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,280
There were many versions of what happened next -

176
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,280
verse of varying quality and paintings like this one,

177
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,320
portraying heroic lancers spearing German gunners.

178
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,040
But all this is pure moonshine.

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,400
The cavalry hurtled down here,

180
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,560
heading for the German guns just the other side of the sugar factory.

181
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,280
They were stopped by wire, not fire. An innocent Belgian farmer's fence.

182
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,760
But it ran right in front of the German gun line

183
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,840
and they simply couldn't get beyond it.

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,320
Capt Francis Grenfell remembered

185
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,160
they ran up and down in front of it like rabbits.

186
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,840
Of course, they were easy targets, as Harry Easton tells us.

187
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,240
Something hit my horse in the neck, just in front of me, and it fell.

188
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,760
It took me out of the saddle and I lost the horse.

189
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Well, I lost the lot.

190
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,120
And I am reminded of the Biblical saying of "Though I walk

191
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,480
"through the valley of death, I had no staff to comfort me."

192
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,040
Major Tom Bridges of the 4th Dragoon Guards was luckier.

193
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,840
His horse was hit just here.

194
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,680
He was dragged into a farm building.

195
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,720
Just as the Germans appeared,

196
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,520
someone threw him onto a spare horse and he galloped up the Roman road.

197
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,560
He lost that horse as well. And he was sitting, wondering what to do...

198
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,920
when the Brigade signals officer

199
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,600
purred up in a blue and silver Rolls-Royce and wafted him to safety.

200
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,800
But there was no safety for the Cheshires.

201
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,760
The order to withdraw never reached them,

202
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:39,400
and they were engulfed as German infantry fought its way in with bayonet and rifle butt.

203
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,080
The action at Elouges cost 2nd Corps 2,000 men -

204
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,400
more than the battle of Mons.

205
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Yet it allowed the BEF to begin its retreat.

206
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,960
The men were already tired by marching up to Mons

207
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,000
and they became tireder still marching away from it.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
They crossed the border into France

209
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,320
and Mons' industrial suburbs were replaced by rich farming country.

210
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,680
The retreat imposed a huge strain on British commanders.

211
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,280
And on August 25th, Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, 2nd Corps Commander,

212
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,720
found himself separated from the rest of the BEF

213
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,560
by the Great Forest of Mormal.

214
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,920
We're twenty miles south of Mons and two days into the retreat.

215
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,960
The mighty forest of Mormal lay like a wedge behind the British Army.

216
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,400
It forced Haig's 1st Corps off to the east

217
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,120
and Smith-Dorrien's 2nd Corps to the west.

218
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,160
Already, men were marching in a sort of trance.

219
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,080
Private Frank Richards of the Royal Welch Fusiliers,

220
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,200
who slogged down this road with his mates,

221
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,240
remembered one of them believing he saw a castle twinkling in the woods.

222
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,760
They knew the Germans were close.

223
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,000
Nightly, the horizon was lit from burning villages.

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,960
Many found the plight of refugees hardest to take.

225
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,640
Alan Hanbury-Sparrow wrote of, "this broken torrent of dusty misery,

226
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,680
"wains drawn by great percherons, wagons tugged by oxen.

227
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,280
"Bicycles, tricycles, barrows and shandrydans,

228
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,360
"coagulate and concertina painfully along this via dolorosa."

229
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,640
The "via dolorosa" was to lead to the south,

230
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,880
to Le Cateau.

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,360
The retreat from Mons was sheer hell, especially for the reservists.

232
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,200
They'd been issued with new boots

233
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,840
and these had caused dreadful blisters on the march up.

234
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,080
I've seen infantry there with their feet bleeding.

235
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,920
I've seen men with their boots off and puttees wrapped round them.

236
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,280
I've seen men sobbing and turning around,

237
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,520
asking our officers, "Why the hell can't we fight?

238
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,160
"Why won't you let us fight?"

239
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,080
If we had an average sleep of two to three hours a day,

240
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,400
that's as much as we got.

241
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,680
And now they had the weather to contend with -

242
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,720
scorching hot summer days mixed with sudden downpours.

243
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,680
This is the school in the northern French town of Le Cateau,

244
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,440
birthplace of the painter Matisse.

245
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,680
During the battle of Mons, general headquarters was in this building.

246
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,600
As the British army fell back on Le Cateau, Capt James Jack,

247
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
a newly-appointed staff officer,

248
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,760
was sent to find out what orders there were for his brigade.

249
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,440
When he arrived he was met by an elegant staff officer

250
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,520
who sent him into town for something to eat.

251
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
Jack needed no second bidding

252
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,560
and stuffed himself with omelettes and bread rolls.

253
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,600
But when he came back, the place was empty.

254
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,840
There was, he said, "not even a pencil left behind."

255
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,600
While HQ was quick to retreat,

256
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,920
tired men on blistered feet were much slower.

257
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,960
By nightfall they were still drifting in to Le Cateau.

258
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
General Smith-Dorrien decided to stand and fight.

259
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,000
But he would do so outnumbered, outgunned and alone.

260
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,600
His gamble was that he could deliver a stopping blow

261
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
that would check the relentless pursuit.

262
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,320
The Germans appeared invincible, but they too were exhausted.

263
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,840
Most of them had been marching, day after day, for almost three weeks.

264
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,480
They had also been surprised by the ferocity of the British at Mons.

265
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,640
Smith-Dorrien's gamble wasn't quite as foolhardy as it might have seemed.

266
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,080
# Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag

267
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,840
# And smile, smile, smile...

268
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,200
# While you have lucifers to light your fag,

269
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
# Smile, boys, that's the style!

270
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
# What's the use of worrying?

271
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,920
# It never was worthwhile! So...! #

272
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,000
Le Cateau was the sort of battlefield the men of 1914 expected.

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,360
It was perfect country for an infantry battle -

274
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,560
open, rolling fields.

275
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,800
But it offered little cover from German shells

276
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,560
and the British were to suffer grievously as a result.

277
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
One of the men who fought here

278
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,040
described it as Salisbury Plain without the trees. But he was wrong.

279
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,720
There was one tree.

280
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,160
Shown on the maps then, as now, as l'Arbre Rond - the round tree.

281
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,680
This, I have to say, is a modern replacement.

282
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,280
It was an obvious aiming mark

283
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,440
and it enabled German gunners

284
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,680
to drop their shells right here in the sunken lane, causing casualties.

285
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,080
Lt-Col Ballard of the Norfolks gave orders for it to be cut down.

286
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,120
This was almost finished when the wind changed,

287
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,200
threatening to blow the tree down, blocking the sunken road.

288
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Then Brigade Commander, Count Gleichen,

289
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,280
told Ballard that on no account was this valuable route to be blocked.

290
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,560
The Pioneers had to guy the tree up with ropes

291
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,800
until they could pull it down into the field behind them.

292
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,480
A bizarre thing - worrying about tree-felling during a battle.

293
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,360
Evidence of the fighting at Le Cateau can still be found

294
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
in the fields around the town.

295
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,200
This is a relatively safe piece of First World War debris.

296
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,120
It is a German cartridge for the Mauser 98 infantry rifle.

297
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
We can tell that it is German because it is rimless.

298
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,360
The British version was fatter and had a pronounced rim, here.

299
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,120
Fired in 1914, lying here ever since.

300
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
As the morning of the 26th of August wore on,

301
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
the British took a terrible pounding from the German guns.

302
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
Smith-Dorrien's artillery commandos

303
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,080
had pushed their guns right up into the infantry line.

304
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,840
And when it was time to pull back,

305
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,880
the horses had to be sent forward to extract them.

306
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,920
Le Cateau was to be the last time in British military history

307
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,120
when guns were fought the way they had been at Waterloo,

308
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
wheel-to-wheel within sight of the enemy.

309
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,480
This track was the gun line of 122 battery, Royal Field Artillery.

310
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,680
Its six 18-pounder guns were just there, drawn up in the open.

311
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,000
They took a dreadful hammering,

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,040
first from German artillery, then from infantry and machine guns.

313
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,600
The Germans got some machine guns into the church spire.

314
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,280
Eventually, Smith-Dorrien decided the job was done.

315
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,960
He'd delivered a stopping blow,

316
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,480
and it was time to break clear if he was to have anything left to move.

317
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,040
The two guns here were commanded by Lt Lionel Lutyens,

318
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,000
who wrote home telling us exactly what had happened.

319
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,360
One of his guns was just over here.

320
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,840
The team came in, got over the bank,

321
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,080
hooked the gun in and got it safely away.

322
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,680
Lutyens said, "It was very smart and good."

323
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,200
But the next team came in here.

324
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,040
The bank was a bit too high and the horses wouldn't take it.

325
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,640
A machine gunner, perhaps one in the church tower,

326
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,160
brought down the drivers and then the horses too.

327
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,680
To Lutyens, there seemed to be nobody left alive.

328
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,400
He then glanced into the sunken road

329
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,800
and saw that his trusty groom had kept his charger Bronco.

330
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,880
He managed to get one foot up into Bronco's stirrup

331
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
and Bronco began to move backwards.

332
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,880
Lutyens remembered that he was "shaking with excitement and funk."

333
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
Then he was into the saddle and away up the hill.

334
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,720
By evening, it seemed that Smith-Dorrien's gamble had worked.

335
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,760
The survivors slipped away from the battlefield in broad daylight.

336
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,480
There were many days of retreat ahead,

337
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,760
but the pursuit would never again be so close.

338
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,440
Some of them came back through this village of Bertry.

339
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,840
And the extraordinary tale of one of them

340
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,520
is still remembered by the local inhabitants.

341
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,440
THEY SPEAK IN FRENCH

342
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,120
I am here being looked after by the station master at Bertry,

343
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,600
and his father.

344
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,280
And they are telling the story about Private Fowler and Corporal Hull,

345
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,560
of the 11th Hussars, who got cut off here in the village

346
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,480
and were looked after by the inhabitants.

347
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,000
Hull unfortunately was caught by the Germans

348
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,880
and as he was in civilian clothes he was shot.

349
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
The head of the house that had looked after him

350
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,880
was deported to Germany and never seen again. But Fowler was luckier.

351
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,320
He was looked after by Madame Belmont, who kept him

352
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,960
in a wardrobe for most of the day, and he was allowed out at night.

353
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,360
He actually spent the whole war like that.

354
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,640
In October 1918, a patrol of the 11th Hussars, led by Major Drake,

355
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,600
came back into the village.

356
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,560
They saw a strange dishevelled creature

357
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,560
being led along by a patrol of Canadians.

358
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,800
As they went past he shouted out,

359
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,000
"I know him, that is Mr Drake, my troop officer!"

360
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,240
And it was in fact Fowler recognising Drake,

361
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,000
who had been his troop leader in 1914.

362
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,600
Le Cateau is largely forgotten today,

363
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,480
overshadowed by bigger, bloodier battles.

364
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,360
But it gave the British a reprieve

365
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,000
and helped give the Allies time to regroup for a counter-offensive,

366
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,040
one of many that would eventually cripple an entire generation.

367
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
By the end of 1914,

368
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
of those thousand-strong battalions we've followed,

369
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,680
there remained, on average, one officer and thirty men.

370
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,320
It's as well that soldiers can't see the future.

371
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,280
The day after Le Cateau,

372
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,840
some of Smith-Dorrien's men crossed a little river here in Voyennes

373
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,000
in exactly the same spot as Henry V,

374
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,880
on his way to Agincourt, 499 years before.

375
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,840
The river? It's called the Somme.

376
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,520
