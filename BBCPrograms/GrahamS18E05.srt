1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
On the show tonight, we have the stars of the new Bond film, Spectre.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,760
But I'm a bit tied up. I need someone to come and save me.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,560
I wish they've hurry up and save me.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,480
CHEERING

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,800
Oh! Thank God!

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,200
Yes! No, no, shut up!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,440
Hi!

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
- How you doing, Graham?
- I'm good. Er...a little help here, please?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,520
- Is that the time? You've lost weight.
- Daniel, no!

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,640
Let's start the shooooooow!

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,160
Oh!

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,920
CHEERING

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,880
Well...

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,080
Good evening, all. Good evening, all. Welcome, welcome, welcome, all.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,440
Oh, I love the smell of burning crotch in the evening.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,840
Now...a great show for you tonight

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,320
and, of course, later on, there will be a full orchestra right there,

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,800
for a stunning musical performance by Mr Sam Smith, everybody.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,080
Yes, there will. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't miss it. Yes, James Bond is in town. He's back.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,640
But, of course, he's not the only one.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,960
No, the Chinese Premier's been here.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,120
The Queen laid on a lavish banquet for him.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,440
There they all are - the Queen, Princess Kate, David Cameron -

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,880
all at the top table.

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,080
This is where they sat Jeremy Corbyn.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,200
LAUGHTER

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
Now, after the banquet,

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,480
the Chinese Premier stayed the night at Buckingham Palace.

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
- CROWD:
- Oooooooh! 
- Now, no, stop that!

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,120
Nothing happened!

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
The Queen isn't like that.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Her Majesty has only even taken one man to her bed chamber.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,680
Ooh! LAUGHTER

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
Let's get some guests on!

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,600
He is a double Oscar winner for Quentin Tarantino's last two films,

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Now, he's the latest in a long line of brilliant Bond villains.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,480
Please welcome Christoph Waltz!

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Hello, sir!

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,680
Really nice to meet you. Have a seat, do.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
Christoph Waltz!

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
She scared us in 28 Days Later,

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
thrilled us in Pirates Of The Caribbean

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,640
and moved us in Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,960
Now, she's reinvented the role of Miss Moneypenny. It's Naomie Harris!

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,120
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Oh, it's the '60s!

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
So '60s!

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
It's very nice. Come in, have a seat.

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,160
And this man needs no introduction.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,000
He's already the most successful James Bond of all time

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
and now he's back.

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,960
Please welcome Daniel Craig!

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,600
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
Hello! It's lovely to see you.

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,800
They're excited tonight, I tell you.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,920
Oh, good show. Welcome, all. Welcome, all.

59
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,240
You must be all in a good mood.

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,760
Everyone loves the new movie. It's all excellent.

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,240
You've done it, it's great! Relax...

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,480
- And now we're here. 
- LAUGHTER

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
Now, don't you start!

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
Now, Christoph, er... VAL-tz?

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
- Correct?
- Yeah. 
- Oh, good!
- Not wrong, at least.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,480
- LAUGHTER 
- It can be tricky, this.

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
I aim that high!

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,160
Erm, have you been on a British talk show before?

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,440
- Erm... I might have, but if I have, then I forgot.
- OK.

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
You've blanked it from your mind.

71
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,840
Now, Naomie Harris, great to have you on the show.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
Tell us about you as an actor.

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,600
You take such a variety of roles, so people may not even know

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,960
that they enjoyed you in Pirates Of The Caribbean.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,160
Cos this... That's you!

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,320
- Er, which is quite a strong look. 
- It's a very strong look.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,440
I tried to actually rock that look, very unsuccessfully, actually.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,080
The black lipstick, the dreadlocks...

79
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
It's not good in real life.

80
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,800
No?

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,680
- Where did you try to rock that look? 
- Just out on a Friday night.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
- As you do!
- Yeah. "Who's she?!

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,760
"She's been watching Pirates Of The Caribbean..."

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,360
And the odd thing about when you're making a movie like this,

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Daniel, you do hurt yourself a lot.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,520
Like, in the previous ones, what's happened to you?

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,880
Erm... I've had my right shoulder reconstructed.

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,160
I've had this left knee operated on, my right knee operated on...

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
- Er... My thumb hurts... 
- LAUGHTER

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
- Dry scalp.
- A lot!

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,480
Itchy crotch.

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,960
It's very difficult!

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,120
So, you get to do all the action and running around and Naomie, now,

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,920
last time you did.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,600
You trained, you were out there.

96
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,680
We've got a shot of you giving it your all. Here you are. Look at that!

97
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
It's great.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
She cares!

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
Naomie cares a lot more than that lady does.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
Does she even know she's...?

101
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,720
She looks like, "Why are they filming me shopping?!"

102
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't think she's in the movie.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Didn't you have a thing when you were doing action stunts with...?

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,320
Was that an extra? When you were doing the driving?

105
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,440
Yeah, I had to drive into a crowd of people and everybody,

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,520
all the extras were supposed to part, like a sea, for the car -

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,720
as you would do for a moving vehicle coming in your direction.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,880
And one extra decided to just be a kamikaze and just, like,

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,360
dive in front of the car.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,560
So, I almost ran him over, which was absolutely terrifying.

111
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Was that a money-making scheme on his part?

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
- I don't know what was going through his head.
- You didn't hit him.

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,080
No, I didn't hit him, because I have very good reflexes.

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,440
- Very good driving skills. 
- Yes!
- I can attest to that.

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,560
Christoph, you weren't injured in this film.

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,400
- Not on this one, no. 
- No, no, because...

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Yes, I'm trying to think...

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,040
- But you have been injured on a film.
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,640
Well, you know, you get injured as you go along. Of course you do.

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
Mostly psychologically.

121
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
LAUGHTER

122
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Er, but was it Django Unchained that you had to ride a horse?

123
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Are you a natural horseman?

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Erm, oh... I think I'm more naturally a horse than a horseman.

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
- But...
- Hello! OK.

126
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,040
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
If you say so!

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
I'll say it. That's me.

129
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,360
Good to know. I'll make a note.

130
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,760
Yeah, erm, I mean, whatever I will say now will top that thing,

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,160
so I'll refrain.

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,200
- We'll just leave it at that. 
- Yes, please.
- You're a horse.

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,280
And, Christoph, literally, we just met.

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
- We've never met before.
- Yes.

135
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,520
And you seem very nice. Erm...

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
But, you know, what's useful, though, for me as an interviewer is -

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,440
I don't know if you know this - your fans on your fan page

138
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,120
have put together a handy list of dos and don'ts for the interviewer.

139
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,640
Which, some, I think are very good.

140
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,360
This is the site here. So you go down to the bottom.

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,920
There's some very good ones like, "Be humble."

142
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,800
That's good. "Do your homework. Show respect." All very good.

143
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Some of them I feel are going to be a little more challenging. Er, like,

144
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,000
"Please do not ask him to describe his character in the film

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,560
"or to describe the film."

146
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't!

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't.

148
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,840
Time for music!

149
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,920
It's all on you guys, OK?

150
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,800
Now, the new Bond film, Spectre.

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
It opens everywhere this Monday and, er,

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,880
obviously, James Bond, Miss Moneypenny...

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Are we allowed to ask you the name of your character?

154
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,560
You can ask anything you want.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
- Who are you playing? 
- Franz Oberhauser.

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,840
HE GASPS OK.

157
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,040
- That's all I really wanted to know. 
- There you go.

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,520
- Baby steps. Baby steps.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,680
- Does it say on the website? 
- No, it doesn't say baby steps.

160
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
- I'll put that up there. I'll type that in later.
- Please.

161
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
"Take baby steps."

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,280
So, what can any of you tell us about the plot?

163
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
SILENCE

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,760
LAUGHTER

165
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,000
I haven't actually seen it, so I can't tell you much, at all.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Wait, I've seen it - you're in it and you haven't seen it?

167
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,320
It's very good. I think you'll be pleased.

168
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
You - excellent!

169
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,200
- Seriously, it is really good. You've seen it, right?
- Yes, I have.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
- Have you seen it?
- I have.
- Oh, phew!

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160
- Oh, good.
- You're waiting.
- I'm waiting for the Royal Premiere.
- OK.

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,840
To see it with my family, you know.

173
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
All right!

174
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,240
"I'm not going to watch it by myself with these losers!

175
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
"I'm going to go with the Royal Family. Then, I'll watch it."

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,400
So, you can't tell us anything about it.

177
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Can you tell us anything about the plot?

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
- HE SIGHS 
- Erm...

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
I could sort of quote you the...

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,360
the trailer, but I mean, people have seen that.

181
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,040
- Bond discovers something from his past.
- Good, good. Excellent.

182
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
- And he gets a message from the past.
- Oh, yes?

183
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,840
- And he...goes rogue. 
- Goes rogue, yes.
- And he...

184
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,840
..gets together with a few women, drives a nice car.

185
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,400
- Shoots a few people, gets in a fight.
- Yeah?
- Hurts his knee a bit.

186
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,600
And... Yeah, that's all I've got.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,040
OK, that's good. What more do you want?

188
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
Hey, let's start with a reminder of why everyone loves James Bond.

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
This is big.

190
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Wow! APPLAUSE

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,160
That's the opening sequence in Mexico and what's...

192
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,960
- Like, those are real people.
- Yeah, we... There were a lot of people.

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
We made more people.

194
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeah, but still, that opening sequence in Mexico -

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,800
- because it is really Mexico, isn't it?
- It is. It's Mexico City, yes.

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,760
We filmed there and it was remarkable.

197
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,000
I mean, we had about 2,000 extras, I think.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Erm, they all had to be in costume, they all had to be in make-up

199
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,640
and they were some of the best extras I've ever worked with.

200
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,760
They were so enthusiastic.

201
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,320
You've been on a movie set.

202
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,040
It's just repetition, repetition, repetition...

203
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,440
- I was the extra.
- Uh-huh.

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,600
But you must have shut Mexico City, did you?

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,720
- I mean... 
- We did, we closed it down, yeah.

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,560
And we flew helicopters around the streets and they gave us

207
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,960
lots of permissions I don't think you get in many cities.

208
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,400
Well, no, because you are doing proper helicopter stunts

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,680
- over real people.
- Yeah, we made it safe. We weren't...

210
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,000
We weren't going to put anybody in danger.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,040
OK...

212
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,040
This is the most expensive Bond movie of all time, is that correct?

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
I think so.

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,160
Well, no, it ought to be. You go everywhere!

215
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
It's more locations than ever before.

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
Well, I mean, I think

217
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,200
that Sam had set something in motion with Skyfall and...

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,880
You know, we made a lot of money on that movie.

219
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,680
It was a very, very successful movie,

220
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
which is a high-class problem to have, but...

221
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,080
We had to make this better.

222
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,240
So, really we just wanted to make the best Bond film we could

223
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,960
and that means going to locations and being as glamorous

224
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,160
as we possibly can and just, sort of, throwing the kitchen sink at it.

225
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,760
And travelling around. Roger Moore, when I talked to him,

226
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,640
he talked about how it didn't matter where he went. He could show up

227
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,160
in a village in Timbuktu and people would go "James Bond, James Bond."

228
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,640
Were any of these locations...?

229
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,760
Could you go there and people didn't know that you were James Bond?

230
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,800
Erm...

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
- No. No, no.
- That's crazy, isn't it?
- It is crazy.

232
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,400
I can't get my head around it at all.

233
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,720
I mean, I've been in some very remote locations.

234
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
You've got to think - there isn't a cinema,

235
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
you don't have a television,

236
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,920
how the hell do you know who I am? And yet, they do.

237
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
I think most people do have televisions, I mean...

238
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
There are very few places.

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,480
- So...
- And because you are "James Bond", presumably people...

240
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Do they treat you differently?

241
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Are there perks, are there downsides?

242
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,800
I get treated very, very, very well.

243
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
And I have to, kind of, keep my feet on the ground,

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,160
otherwise it would really go to my head -

245
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,280
more than it's gone to my head, already.

246
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,600
Cos I heard you saying that drinks just appear.

247
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,400
It doesn't matter where you are, drinks appear.

248
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Usually, sort of, at nine o'clock in the morning, as well.

249
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,960
- Someone just sends it.
- Hello!

250
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,680
There's not much wrong with that. No, you're right.

251
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,040
- Erm...
- Oh, is that why? You don't want to offend people?

252
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah, yeah!

253
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,600
- That's why he's drunk all day. 
- It's a good excuse.

254
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
Cos you were warned, when you went into Skyfall,

255
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,960
weren't you warned that this was going to change your life, Naomie?

256
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,400
- Yeah. 
- So, how has it affected your life?

257
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,440
It hasn't, really.

258
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,080
LAUGHTER

259
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,480
- Seriously, like...
- No drinks? Nothing?
- No, no drinks for me.

260
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,520
But I can go on the Tube, the buses, sit under a poster of myself

261
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,920
and no-one notices, at all.

262
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,440
- So...
- Is that disappointing?

263
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a little bit disappointing.

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
That was a bit like a cry from the heart.

265
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,360
If you do see her out and about, ladies and gentlemen...

266
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
Shout out her name!

267
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,480
If you could mob her, get selfies, things like that.

268
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
Just, yeah, get strangers involved. Erm...

269
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,840
Now, Naomie, when you went for this,

270
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,440
did you know you were going to be Moneypenny?

271
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,520
Or did you think you'd be one of the Bond girls?

272
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,080
No, I was asked to audition as a Bond girl,

273
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
for the role of a Bond girl,

274
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,760
and I just went in for a laugh, to be honest,

275
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
because I know they audition thousands of people

276
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,680
all around the world and I just thought I was one of many.

277
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,160
I didn't really think I had a chance in hell, really, of getting it.

278
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,560
But was your Moneypenny, sort of, a Bond girl?

279
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,800
No, she is Moneypenny.

280
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,920
But the idea was I would audition for a Bond girl and then...

281
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,080
- Be so brilliant, you were Moneypenny.
- Yes.

282
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,120
No, then they would tell me that the role was actually for Moneypenny.

283
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,240
Oh, I see!

284
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,680
- They're messing with your mind... 
- Exactly, exactly.

285
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,440
OK. Did you ever find out what your Bond girl name would have been?

286
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,560
Erm, it would have been Kiki Martin.

287
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Kiki Martin. OK. I don't know if you know how this works.

288
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,040
Last time Daniel was here, yours was Cock Hargreaves.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Basically, it's whatever you call your private area.

290
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
We've talked about that before.

291
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,040
Yes. We know what you call yours.

292
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,320
And, er...Neddy.

293
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,600
And, er... And then your grandmother's maiden name.

294
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,840
What was yours again?

295
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,600
- Kiki Martin.
- Kiki Martin?
- Mmhm.

296
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Cock, meet Kiki. Kiki, Cock.

297
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
As a child! As a child, you said as a child, right?

298
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah. Or now, I don't care.

299
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
Hiya!

300
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Kiki Martin. Kiki Martin's a good name.

301
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
What would your Bond girl name be, Christoph?

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,880
Oo-ee...

303
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
It would be, erm...

304
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,120
- Well, we called it Horsey.
- Horsey.

305
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,040
Er... Horsey... Horsey Mayen.

306
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
Horsey Mayen!

307
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
Wow!

308
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,920
It sounds like a cross between horse radish and mayonnaise, doesn't it?

309
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,840
I'll have that with Horsey Mayen.

310
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
Delicious!

311
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
Now, here's a thing.

312
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,040
In Skyfall, Naomie and Daniel, you had that very sexy,

313
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,240
potentially-dangerous scene, with the shaving.

314
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,560
CHEERING

315
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,480
Now which of you, or were either of you nervous going into that scene?

316
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,120
You must have been a bit nervous?

317
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,000
- No, she practised. 
- I did. For six weeks, no less.

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Were there a lot of bleeding extras?

319
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,280
- Members of the crew who came in and I'd practise on them.
- Really?

320
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah, in their lunch break. They liked it.

321
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,640
Did they have a choice?

322
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,760
Maybe not. I don't know.

323
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
Crying...

324
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,960
"I have children!"

325
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,720
You... Did you do the classic training on a balloon thing?

326
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes, I did. Mm-hm.

327
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,280
Now, we heard that you were exceptionally good at shaving...

328
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, it took me six weeks, so I don't think I was that good.

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,560
OK. So could you still do it?

330
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,760
If I got you to shave a balloon, could you still do it?

331
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,920
- I could give it a go. 
- All right. She's game.

332
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,400
- I've got the bits of equipment here. 
- Do we need to blow up the balloon?

333
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,240
- Well, we've got to blow up the balloon. Can you do that?
- I'll try.

334
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,200
You've got children. You must have done parties.

335
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,920
It's good. It's not as big as your head yet.

336
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
- Don't look at me! 
- No, I'm not looking.

337
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,880
LAUGHTER

338
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,760
I can't do it if you're watching.

339
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,680
I'll shut my eyes.

340
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,640
This'll be in the next Bond film.

341
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,120
GRAHAM LAUGHING

342
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,160
- More?
- It's nearly as big as your head, keep going.

343
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,080
There, that's about right now. If you just want to tie it off.

344
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,800
And, now, Christoph, you're an artist.

345
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,720
I wonder, could you put Daniel's face on the balloon?

346
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Thank you very much.

347
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,920
Lovely.

348
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,160
LAUGHTER

349
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,400
Please be kind!

350
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,840
It's a pink balloon. How kind can he be?

351
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
- We're going to put shaving foam on it.
- OK.

352
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Are you confident you won't burst this?

353
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,560
Cos if you burst this, we are all going to be covered in this.

354
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,440
- No pressure, then!
- Let's see you.

355
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,200
Oh, actually, let's have a look. Turn like that.

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
APPLAUSE

357
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,520
- I'm not sure that applause is a good thing.
- I'm not, either.

358
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,320
OK. Can you soap it up, or do you want me to soap it up?

359
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,480
- You can soap it up.
- OK. OK.
- Do you want me to hold it?
- Why don't you?

360
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes, thank you very much. HE HUMS

361
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
- Have you done this before?
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,120
- Er, OK, I'll put lots on.
- Yeah.

363
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,480
- It'll be easier to get off that way, won't it?
- No!

364
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
- OK.
- Harder.

365
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
LAUGHTER

366
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,880
OK, so, if you want to stand up, and I'd say shove down, you guys,

367
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,240
cos you're wearing expensive clothes.

368
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,920
- Er, OK...
- So I'm going to sit. 
- Oh, you're going to sit? OK.

369
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,080
It's up to you. OK, I'll hold it for you. I'll hold it.

370
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,840
- Right...
- Oh... Oh, God.

371
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,880
- OK.
- This is unbearable.

372
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
Argh! Argh, argh, argh...

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,440
There's a towel. There's a towel,

374
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,240
there's a towel. APPLAUSE

375
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,400
- Perfect.
- OK.

376
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,240
It's around the lips that you have to be really careful.

377
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
It's a balloon!

378
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,600
Are you going to do this? You are, aren't you?

379
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, because I was trained by the amazing Tony.

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
Of Guy? LAUGHTER

381
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,920
Oh, well done, you!

382
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,680
Excellent, very good! APPLAUSE

383
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,120
That's, er... That's...

384
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,400
There, it's gone. It's gone.

385
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,560
We'll have to explain that later.

386
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,960
How will we recover? That's so impressive!

387
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
- Thank you!
- Yeah!

388
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,000
Something to fall back on, isn't it? Something to fall back on.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,440
All right, let's enjoy another taste of Spectre.

390
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,280
This is Daniel Craig with Christoph Waltz, who is...

391
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
They're just having a chat.

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,040
- Yes.
- You're just having a chat.

393
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,360
Information is all...

394
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,440
..is it not?

395
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,960
For example, you must know by now

396
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,920
that the 00 programme is officially dead...

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,440
..which leads me to speculate exactly why you came.

398
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,120
So, James,

399
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,000
why did you come?

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,320
I came here to kill you.

401
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,640
And I thought you came here to die.

402
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

403
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,360
WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE

404
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
Now...

405
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
Now, this started for you...

406
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,680
You were a working actor all your life, you worked away,

407
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,760
and then this crazy thing happened, where suddenly you have global fame.

408
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah, but with me, I'm the other end of the spectrum.

409
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,440
When people see me, they duck and run.

410
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,400
But the thing is, like everyone else,

411
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
we discovered you on that world stage

412
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,640
when you did Inglourious Basterds, but I assumed you'd been

413
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
- just busy working in Germany, Austria, whatever...
- Yeah.

414
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,360
..but when you were young, though, you did try to crack America.

415
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,920
Yeah, I did.

416
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,600
I was there for about two years, waiting on tables, then I said,

417
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,560
"Do I want to be a waiter?"

418
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,320
Since I didn't, I went back.

419
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,320
So how did Quentin Tarantino find you?

420
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
Well, he had to look hard.

421
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,720
In the end, he was rewarded, let's say.

422
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
APPLAUSE

423
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,080
- He did change your life. 
- Totally, completely.

424
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,960
Two Oscars. You've now got as many Oscars as he does,

425
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,480
which must be kind of annoying for him.

426
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,840
Well, the way I see it is, he kind of wrote the stuff that he

427
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,200
- offered me to win an Oscar with. 
- Yeah.
- So I'm indebted to him.

428
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Now, going back to your early acting days...

429
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,600
..there was a television programme.

430
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
What age were you when you were in - I think I'm saying it right -

431
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Am Dam Des?

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah...

433
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,840
What age? Mmm, I don't know.

434
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,960
- Hmm, maybe 19?
- 19.

435
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,080
Now, don't laugh too much, because we've got crap on you, as well.

436
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,840
This is a clip... Listen, we've all done things.

437
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,840
This is a clip from Am Dam Des,

438
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,360
but even in this, I think you can see the glimmer of greatness

439
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,880
that would one day lead to two Oscars.

440
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,680
HE SNORTS Roll the clip.

441
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,040
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

442
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,160
- HE SINGS:
- # Ich bin das neue Jahr

443
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,600
# Bin junger als das alte war

444
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,720
# Wie viel?

445
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,680
# Das ist jetzt die Frage

446
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,680
# Um 365 Tage. #

447
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,360
Oh, beautiful! CHEERING

448
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Could you repeat that? I missed the last part.

449
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,120
So just because... Why did it say "1977" on you?

450
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
Because I was the new year.

451
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,240
Couldn't you tell?

452
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
You were certainly festive!

453
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,800
Did you keep the outfit? It's extraordinary.

454
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,920
I would like that - a New Year's outfit.

455
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Yeah, it really is. Nothing says "New Year" like a knitted leotard.

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
But...

457
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,680
But, Daniel Craig, we turn to you.

458
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Because you started very young, as well.

459
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,880
- STRAINED:
- Yes...

460
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,160
You were in school, in the National Youth Theatre.

461
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,600
When did you do panto? How old were you when you did panto?

462
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,360
Um...15, 14?

463
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,760
- 15, 14.
- Yeah.

464
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
Now, annoyingly, we only have a still,

465
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,600
but it's still a quality picture, it's still a quality still.

466
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,200
This is Daniel Craig. See if you can spot which one he is.

467
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,760
He is one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella.

468
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,520
Can we zoom in on the faces?

469
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,960
Right or left, ladies and gentlemen?

470
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,680
- AUDIENCE:
- Left!

471
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,200
- Left.
- Yep.

472
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,080
Do you know who that is?

473
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,200
Um, I think it's, um...

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,520
- (Richard Kelly.) RELIEVED:
- Oh, thank you!

475
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
A long time ago. Richard Kelly.

476
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,520
Richard Kelly! Yay! He's here tonight. No, he's not.

477
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,120
Where was that?

478
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,400
At school. A school production of Cinderella.

479
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,280
- You really went for it, didn't you? 
- That's my career right there.

480
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,320
Commitment, ladies and gentlemen.

481
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Now, annoyingly, cos we kind of thought,

482
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,040
"Oh, Naomie was a child star! This will be hilarious."

483
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,680
No, Naomie - just ado-ra-ble!

484
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,840
- Aww!
- Is it Simon And The Witch you were in?
- Yes.

485
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,720
Look at Naomie, look at this.

486
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
- Oh, God.
- Look at that! AUDIENCE:
- Aww!

487
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,040
Aww!

488
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,520
You credit Danny Boyle for rescuing you from that side of your career.

489
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,160
Yeah, yeah, he actually gave me the part in 28 Days Later

490
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,240
when I'd just left drama school and that completely changed my career.

491
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,440
Then, he also gave me a part in Frankenstein, at the National,

492
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,680
which is the reason why I'm in Bond, in fact,

493
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,920
cos Sam Mendes came to see it, and Debbie McWilliams,

494
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,120
and that's how I got cast.

495
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- Yeah.

496
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
If you're in it.

497
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,160
APPLAUSE

498
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,960
We've got to ask you, Daniel,

499
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,160
how annoying is it when you're actually making a film,

500
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
you're actually out there, you're hurting your knee

501
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,840
your running down the street, you're reversing cars

502
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,080
and the papers are just full of who's going to be Bond next?

503
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,520
That must be a bit irksome.

504
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I just ignore it. I don't really get involved with it,

505
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,840
so that's the way I deal with it.

506
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,320
There's always a...

507
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,520
There's always speculation round a Bond movie.

508
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
There's lots of excitement and lots of people have different opinions,

509
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,120
but I suppose that's just because we're hopefully getting it right

510
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,480
and that people are still interested, which is the best bit.

511
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,440
And if this film, as it looks like it's going to do,

512
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,480
does amazing business - blockbuster, blockbuster - presumably,

513
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,600
they'll just throw so much money at you, you'll have to do another one.

514
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,640
I would genuinely say this - I have never done any job for the money.

515
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,800
I've only ever...

516
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,560
You mightn't have been offered this much money before, though.

517
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,440
That's true.

518
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,920
That's true, but it's, uh...

519
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,760
I can't think about another one right at the moment,

520
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
because we've, literally, finished this one

521
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,920
and this is the best bit.

522
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,600
Now that all I care about is getting the film in front of an audience

523
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,760
and we'll see. I don't know.

524
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,600
- We hope you do.
- That's very nice. 
- Fingers crossed, you do.

525
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,280
Listen, just before we meet Sam Smith,

526
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,840
this is very sweet. I don't know if you guys have seen this.

527
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,280
Someone posted it online and it's by an eight-year-old boy,

528
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,520
an eight-year-old boy wrote this, and it's, kind of, his review of Bond

529
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,160
and, through the eyes of a child,

530
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,480
really, this does capture the enduring appeal of James Bond.

531
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,360
He wrote, "Once there was a guy named Bond, James Bond.

532
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,440
"He was from Inglend.

533
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,400
"He was a very good actor in movies.

534
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,000
"He has a friend named M.

535
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,040
"James Bond gous in gun movies.

536
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,000
"And he never dies in all his movies.

537
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
"There are different actors. Some are not good.

538
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,520
"Some are good.

539
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,200
"Some are amazing.

540
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
"And at the end of the movies, there is kissey-kissey parts.

541
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,400
"I like them."

542
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,040
APPLAUSE

543
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,320
That's the plot.

544
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,120
Right, it is time for our musical guest tonight.

545
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,200
This man is a true home-grown superstar who's done it all.

546
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
He's won Brits and Grammys and now he's a world record-breaker

547
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,120
with his Bond theme, Writing's On The Wall.

548
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,040
Please welcome Sam Smith, everybody!

549
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,800
WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE

550
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,920
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How are you? 
- Lovely to see you.

551
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,720
THEY GREET EACH OTHER

552
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,760
There you go, sir. Have you guys all met before, or is this it?

553
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
- Just out there.
- Out there now.

554
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,840
- We shouldn't say that, should we? 
- If it's true, why not say it?

555
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,520
We did, just now. It's nice to meet you.

556
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,480
Because you heard the song fairly early on, Daniel, didn't you?

557
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, I got...

558
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,760
You'd just recorded it, hadn't you?

559
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,080
Sent us a copy of it and I sat in a room with Sam

560
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,680
- and stuck some headphones on and... 
- That early on? That's scary.

561
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,960
Have you seen it in the film yet?

562
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,800
- No, I'm the same as you. I haven't seen it.
- I haven't seen it, either.

563
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
- I want to save it for me and my family.
- Exactly.

564
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,120
All about the event, you know?

565
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,960
Oh, cos when you see it in the title sequence,

566
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,920
- it's so different. 
- I love how you've seen it, as well.

567
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm sure you could have seen it, if you'd wanted to.

568
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,600
I was offered to, but I'm so excited for Monday. It'll be beautiful.

569
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
How does it happen? Do you get a call? Do you make the call?

570
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,880
I got a call to go to Pinewood Studios, to meet Sam and Barbara,

571
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,560
and I didn't know what that meant.

572
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,240
- Sam Mendes and Barbara Broccoli.
- Yes.

573
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,760
Babs Broccoli, you know her.

574
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,480
- So, you go for the meeting...
- Yes, went in there, went into the office.

575
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,040
Lovely people, it was great,

576
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,480
and they gave me the script.

577
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
I couldn't believe it, they gave me script,

578
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,040
there's my name across it. You guys probably know this.

579
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,400
There's your name across every page,

580
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,840
which is scary as shit.

581
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
If you leave it somewhere...

582
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, because if you leave it, everything's blamed on me.

583
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,640
- Yeah.
- Then I read the script, then I had a crack at the song.

584
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,080
But on the day, were they seeing other people?

585
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,600
- I think so, I don't know.
- Metallica.

586
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,520
"Metallica"!

587
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,000
It's like, when you first start dating someone, isn't it?

588
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
"Are you still seeing other people?"

589
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
"Yes."

590
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,240
- So, you write the song, you send it off.
- Yes.

591
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Could they have gone, "Meh, not so much"?

592
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
I guess so. Thank God they didn't.

593
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,600
I was prepared to do many versions

594
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,720
- if they wanted me to. 
- You were?
- Yeah.

595
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,600
But they did ask for some changes, is this right?

596
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes, because lyrically, I think I'm quite a vulnerable writer,

597
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
quite an emotional writer,

598
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,360
and James Bond is quite a strong character...

599
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,320
I love that I'm telling you who you are.

600
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,360
Not that you are James Bond.

601
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,000
He IS James Bond.

602
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,240
We needed some tweaks lyrically, so Sam,

603
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,080
it was a massive collaboration between me and Sam,

604
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,440
because this fits with the film, I think,

605
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,120
and I wanted it to fit the storyline. It's hard, actually,

606
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,480
to bring out a song before the film's even come out,

607
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,320
cos, hopefully, when you see the film, it will all make more sense.

608
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,560
Like I say, when you see it in that opening title...

609
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,960
The opening title sequence is gorgeous.

610
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,840
- I'm talking to people who've seen it.
- I'm so excited.

611
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,640
It's really beautiful and, of course, the single is still out,

612
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,720
people can get the single.

613
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,520
Tonight, this is a world exclusive.

614
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,400
- You've never performed this song live.
- Never.

615
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,360
And I'm dreading it, absolutely dreading it.

616
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,440
- You wrote the song! 
- I know, but do you know what?

617
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,440
I've only actually sung the song once, really,

618
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,360
because I did the demo in the studio and they used that.

619
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,480
It is horrible to sing. Horrible.

620
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,280
I regret... No, I don't regret.

621
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,640
- Why is it so bad to sing? 
- It's just so high.

622
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,920
I have to grab my balls, it's awful.

623
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,560

the first live performance of the new Bond theme.

628
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,400
We're so excited you're doing it for us.

629
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,080
A bored orchestra awaits.

630
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,600
- Do go and join them.
- I shall.

631
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,400

Shortly, we'll have this week's stories from the big red chair,

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,920
# Tell me, is this where I give it all up?

677
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
# For you, I have to risk it all

678
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,800
# Cos the writing's on

679
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,520
# The wall. #

680
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

681
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,200
Sam Smith, everyone!

682
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,760
Wow!

683
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,360
That was stunning.

684
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,560
Thank you so, so much.

685
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,640
Come and sit down.

686
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,880
Have a seat there. How good was that?!

687
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,760
CHEERING CONTINUES

688
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,840
Wow.

689
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,800
It's amazing to have such a great film

690
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
and then to have that song in it,

691
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,760
- it's phenomenal. You must be thrilled, cock-a-hoop.
- Relieved.

692
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,480
Well, that, too.

693
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,800
Listen, very quickly, before we go onto the red chair,

694
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,720
we were talking about childhood ambitions earlier with the guys,

695
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,440
because apparently as a child, you wanted to be an astronaut,

696
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,560
is this correct?

697
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,840
No.

698
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,120
No, no, I actually didn't.

699
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,720
Are you referring to a certain...?

700
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,440
We have a lovely picture. This is Sam, this is Sam,

701
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,000
living the dream.

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
AUDIENCE ROARS

703
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,720
- Oh, my God!
- Is that Buzz Lightyear?

704
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
Yeah.

705
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,160
You know, I was too fat to fit in that,

706
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,520
it was split open at the back.

707
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,240
I was a fat, fat boy.

708
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,920
So you just take a pic not moving?

709
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,760
"This picture will last forever.

710
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,280
"One day, it will be on television."

711
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,960
OK, let's visit the red chair. Let's see who's there tonight.

712
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
- Ugh. Hello!
- Hey.

713
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,520
What's your name?

714
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,320
Denison. Paul Denison.

715
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,560
Oh, Jesus.

716
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,520
APPLAUSE

717
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,680
I have a sort of chill creeping through my bones

718
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,520
that we're just going to get that over and over again.

719
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,280
OK, fingers crossed, it is not a Bond Special red chair.

720
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
Hello.

721
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,120
- Hi. 
- AUDIENCE WHOOPS

722
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,560
Wow, they're loving you. What's your name, sir?

723
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,920
- My name's Howie Poon. 
- Howie Poon?
- Yes.

724
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,960
LAUGHTER

725
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,760
Is that your Bond Girl name?

726
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,400
That's it.

727
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,880
OK.

728
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,080
And what do you do, sir?

729
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm a flight attendant.

730
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,080
A flight attendant? OK. Transatlantic or domestic?

731
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,360
- For American Airlines. I do international.
- Right, OK.

732
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, yeah!

733
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,920
Do you look after the posh people or just the rabble?

734
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,440
- Just the rabble.
- Yeah, but you treat them nicely, I'm sure.

735
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,600
- Oh, of course, yes.
- So fired.

736
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,120
Off you go with your story.

737
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,360
I had to take my 70-year-old Chinese mom

738
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,280
to her gynaecologist check-up appointment

739
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,160
- and I...
- Can I just say,

740
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,000
already my hopes for this story are so high,

741
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,800
I can't tell you.

742
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,280
So, basically, we get to the office,

743
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,880
I tell her gynaecologist that I have to translate,

744
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
the gynaecologist has a smirk on her face and says,

745
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
"Well, I'm going to have to ask you

746
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,520
"a couple of uncomfortable questions to translate for your mom."

747
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,480
She's like, "I need to know if your mom is sexually active

748
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,080
"and I need to know how active she is."

749
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
NAOMIE GROANS

750
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,960
So keep in mind she's 70 years old.

751
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
I translate in Chinese - I'm like...

752
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,480
HE SPEAKS IN CHINESE LANGUAGE

753
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,640
Basically, that means, "Do you guys still have sex?"

754
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,600
So my mum hits me on the shoulder, she's like,

755
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,120
"You know your dad. Of course we do. Five to six times a week."

756
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,800
AUDIENCE ROARS

757
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,440
APPLAUSE

758
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
Wow!

759
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,120
So, basically, I'm completely embarrassed,

760
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,200
my mom's not even shy about it.

761
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,920
I go from, like, basically embarrassed to depressed

762
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
that my mum and dad are getting more than I am.

763
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,720
Aww!

764
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
Can he walk? You should walk.

765
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,480
Yeah, walk, walk.

766
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,840
APPLAUSE

767
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,320
That's nice, but his mother can't.

768
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,920
OK...

769
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,680
They'll cut that out.

770
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,400
No, they won't!

771
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,840
Let's have another one. One more, one more.

772
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,640
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

773
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,960
- Hello, how are you?
- Good, thank you. How are you?
- I'm very good, thanks.

774
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,560
LAUGHTER

775
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,560
- What's your name?
- My name is Zach Ford.
- Zach Ford? Lovely.

776
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,120
Is that your real name?

777
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,840
- Yes, it is.
- It is tonight. OK!

778
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,920
- And where are you from, Zach Ford? 
- I'm from New Zealand, Dunedin.

779
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,600
LOUD WHOOPING

780
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
I dunno.

781
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,560
- OK, Zach Ford... By the way, do you live here now?
- I do, yeah.

782
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,080
- What do you do here? 
- I'm a primary school teacher.

783
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,680
Really?! OK.

784
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,480
Anyone else surprised? I was quite surprised.

785
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,120
"Zach Ford, primary school teacher."

786
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,680
IN SUAVE VOICE: "Hey, kids, let's count to ten."

787
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,280
He seems too cool.

788
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,920
They must worship you, Zach.

789
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,000
OK, Zach Ford, off you go with your story.

790
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,520
OK, so "a friend of mine"

791
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,240
was meeting his girlfriend's family for the first time.

792
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,680
They were meeting at the beach.

793
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
After meeting everyone, everything was going well

794
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,600
and suddenly, he had the urge to go to the toilet.

795
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,440
At the beach, there is nowhere really to hide behind

796
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,840
to do a number two.

797
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,680
Oh! AUDIENCE GROANS

798
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,280
So, the only place there was left was to go to the water,

799
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,240
so he swam out past the waves

800
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,880
and had himself an aqua-poo.

801
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
After succeeding,

802
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,160
he swam back in,

803
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
feeling pretty chuffed with himself,

804
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,960
got away with not having to go to the toilet in front of the family.

805
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,880
He went to go grab his towel and his girlfriend just looked at him

806
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,680
in disgust and was like, "What is that on your back?"

807
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,840
Oh! AUDIENCE HOWLS

808
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,720
- He was like...
- We can't.

809
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
APPLAUSE That's it.

810
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,040
That's it. That is it for tonight.

811
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,480
Well done, everyone in the big red chair.

812
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,320
All right, that's your lot.

Please say thank you to my guests, Mr Sam Smith!
